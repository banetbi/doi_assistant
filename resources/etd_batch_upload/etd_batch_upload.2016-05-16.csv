College Athletes’ Reflective Judgment:  A Moderator Between Sport And Sociocultural Pressures, Body Ideal Internalization, And Body Dissatisfaction|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Greene_wmed_0261F_10003.pdf|Body Image, College Athletics, College Counseling, Reflective Judgment|The purpose of this research was to investigate the sociocultural model of eating disorder development among male and female college student-athletes as moderated by students’ level of Reflective Judgment, a stage theory of adult epistemology marked by increasing cognitive complexity.  A review of literature on the established relationships between pressures in sociocultural and sport environments to adhere to body ideals and resulting body dissatisfaction as mediated by body ideal internalization was presented.  The Reflective Judgment model was hypothesized as a moderator to body ideal internalization due to its relationship with feminist identity development (a moderator among females) and applicability to both genders to inform current interventions.  A sample of 131 NCAA college student-athletes (33 male; 98 female) completed the Perceived Sociocultural Pressures Scale (PSPS), the Weight Pressures in Sport Scale (WPS), the Body Parts Satisfaction Scale (BPSS), the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Scale-3 (SATAQ-3) and the Reasoning about Current Issues test (RCI).  Multi-sample Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to examine the hypothesized relationships between the variables and revealed significant differences between genders.  In general, males’ higher Reflective Judgment was a full mediator between pressures and body dissatisfaction, resulting in lower body dissatisfaction.  However, females’ higher Reflective Judgment was a moderator between pressures and body ideal internalization, resulting in higher body dissatisfaction.  These major findings as well as additional findings as elaborated by curvilinear regression analysis, current literature, and theories of socialized gender differences in epistemology were presented.  Limitations, areas for further research, and implications for practice were identified. |Catie|A|Greene||cagreene@email.wm.edu|College of William and Mary - School of Education|Victoria A Foster|Thomas J Ward|Charles R McAdams|||Education|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)|Education|http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/|dissertation|10.21220/W4MW2N|0|English||2016-04-12|Spring|None|1463412417

"Teacher And Principal Perceptions Of A New Evaluation Program For Teachers"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Finnegan_wmed_0261F_10004.pdf|"JCSEE, Professional Practices, Student Learning Objective (SLO), Teacher evaluation program"|"The ability to evaluate teachers accurately is indispensable for both the development of effective teachers and for student achievement. In this era of accountability, it is important school districts develop evaluation systems that comply with the propriety, utility, feasibility, and accuracy standards of the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluations. This study focused on a process evaluation of a new teacher evaluation program. While previous studies have been conducted from the teachers or the evaluators’ perspectives, this study examined both perspectives. More than 1,500 teachers and 41 principals were invited to complete an online instrument modified from surveys conducted by Hopkins and Stronge. Of concern to the teachers and principals was the accuracy of the new evaluation program, they did not see the value and validity of using SLOs to improve teaching practices to increase learning, and teachers slightly favored using the professional practices component more than the SLO component of the evaluation. Using SLO data in teacher evaluation is an unknown dynamic for teachers; therefore, school administrators need to understand how teachers perceive this change as it relates to teacher support of the new evaluation process. If districts are to safeguard the fidelity, implementation, and sustainability of new evaluation programs for teachers, districts must acknowledge the influence teacher perceptions have on endorsing implementation efforts toward change. Teachers’ perceptions toward adjusting instructional practices to align with the standards and criteria of new evaluation programs can either hinder or ensure program implementation.

Six African American female adolescents from two different cities participated in this study. Data collection included a semi-structured interview with each participant separately, transcribing each interview, downloading transcribed data into a qualitative data analysis program, and combing data for themes. This study attempted to answer to primary questions: How do Inner City African American female adolescents view womanhood? How does aggressive or violent behavior play a role, or not, in African American adolescent perceptions of womanhood? Data analysis revealed several themes from participant’s interviews: strength, responsibility, education, mom as role model, stereotypes, and finances.

"Community Of Practice: Evaluation Of A Collaboration Program In An Educational Setting"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/CitarelliJones_wmed_0261F_10007.pdf|"Collaboration, Community of Practice"|"Although collaborative programs are used in a variety of educational contexts, during the implementation of new curricula, collaboration among teachers is essential since the difference between curriculum-in-theory and curriculum-in-use lies specifically with teachers’ adherence to the implemented curriculum rather than the curriculum that was written.  When multiple teachers implement a curricular initiative and interact with the materials in different, teacher-specific ways, curriculum fidelity across teachers is a true concern, rendering an evaluation of the curricular program unstable.  For this reason, consistent, embedded collaboration during the first year of new curricula has the potential to provide a vehicle for implementation alignment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a Community of Practice program designed to create a forum and system of collaboration among teachers during the first year of a new curricular program.  The theory of action was that a Community of Practice program, if applied consistently throughout a new curriculum implementation year, would provide an effective collaboration vehicle for consistent and authentic implementation.   Results from the Community of Practice observations, participant interviews and reflection journals indicated that the collaboration program was effective over time.  Training and practice in collaborative protocols, along with careful selection of participants is critical in that the collaborative effort is reliant on the willingness of participants to emerge from their isolation so as to learn from and with their peers.  As it develops, a Community of Practice approach can successfully drive decision-making, support fidelity of implementation, and provide continuous evaluation and discussion.

"A Comparative Case Study Of The Role Of The School District In Influencing School Improvement: Supporting And Turning Around Low-Performing Schools"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Kelly_wmed_0261F_10008.pdf|"DISTRICT LEADERS, DISTRICT ROLES, LOW ACHIEVING, SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT, SCHOOL TURNAROUND, SUPERINTENDENT"|"The purpose of this study was to examine the efforts of school districts in developing and sustaining their capacity to improve student achievement in response to increased accountability. The study sought to confirm what the research says regarding the role of the school district in influencing school improvement. While there is a significant body of research identifying elements for turning around low-performing schools, limited information exists on the roles of school district leaders in influencing school improvement. The study employed comparative case study methodology to examine the details of two school districts that had engaged in turning around low-achieving schools through the viewpoint of the study’s participants (superintendents, assistant superintendents, district leaders overseeing school improvement, and school principals). This study identified the roles and practices of district leaders and determined the strategies used to successfully turn around low performing schools and sustain higher achievement. Increasing achievement across schools necessitates considering how school districts support school improvement and sustain district capacity to improve student achievement. Based on the findings, the study offers recommendations for district leadership practice in supporting school improvement and school turnaround.

"Comprehensive Internationalization:  Examining The What, Why, And How At Community Colleges"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Butler_wmed_0261F_10010.pdf|"community college, comprehensive internationalization, global perspectives, intercultural learning, internationalization"|"Community colleges enroll nearly half of the total U.S. undergraduates, have the most diverse student population, and serve as the only contact with postsecondary education for many students.  Community colleges have engaged in internationalization efforts for decades.  Most rely on study abroad and international students as the only methods to internationalize their campuses.  A focus on study abroad is not an effective method to internationalize the campus and provide all students with the global awareness and skills necessary to be successful in today’s society.  	The American Council on Education Model for Comprehensive Internationalization (2012a), Knight’s (1997) rationales framework, and Knight’s (2004) approaches framework to form the conceptual model to analyze the what (meanings), why (rationales/motivations), and how (strategies and models) of community colleges’ internationalization efforts.  College sites for the study included Montgomery College, Tidewater Community College, and Orange Coast College.  All site colleges participated in one of the American Council on Education’s (ACE) comprehensive internationalization projects.  This qualitative collective case study sought to describe the experience and process of comprehensive internationalization in the community college sector, to identify the perceived rationales and motivations to internationalize, to determine the successes and challenges of the comprehensive internationalization process, and to identify the priority placed on intercultural learning and global awareness across the curriculum.  	The findings revealed several themes on how comprehensive internationalization is being operationalized on the three college campuses.  Three frames emerged, global humanities; intercultural learning; and multicultural and international.  The interviews also revealed changes to becoming more comprehensive in their approach, both multiple motivations/rationales, programmatic and sustainability challenges and success, and revealed evidence of student learning as a priority for internationalizing the campus.  The findings also showed the influence of domestic international diversity, governance, continuity, start and stops on the internationalization process.

"Urban Teachers' Perceptions Of The Implementation Of The Virginia Guidelines For Uniform Performance Standards And Evaluation Criteria For Teachers"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Smith_wmed_0261F_10012.pdf|"Teacher evaluation"|"Urban Teachers’ Perceptions of the Implementation of the Virginia Guidelines for Uniform Performance Standards and Evaluation Criteria for Teachers Abstract An emphasis has been placed on teacher evaluation to improve student achievement; therefore, states such as Virginia have had to revise their teacher evaluation systems. The most recent revisions in Virginia were implemented in 2012. A major component of the revision was the inclusion of student progress in teacher evaluation. Since the inclusion of student progress into teacher evaluation, teachers, and administrators have had to make adjustments in their practices and procedures related to teacher evaluation. Consequently, the purpose of this case study was to examine the perceptions of a sample of teachers regarding the implementation of the revised performance standards and evaluation criteria in 2012. The perceptions of a sample of secondary teachers in a small urban district were examined to identify factors that might influence their perceptions of the performance standards and related topics. The literature review outlined transformations that have occurred in education and their impact on teacher evaluation. Participants were comprised of 12 teachers who were interviewed using a semistructured format as the primary data source. Another source of data was the reviewing of documents. The findings also indicated that teachers possessed primarily positive perceptions of the performance standards in their current teacher evaluation system. Recommendations included on-going professional development (e.g., expanding grade levels for teachers), interviewing administrators, and determining their perceptions of the performance standards.

"School Counselor Involvement In Partnerships With Families Of Color: A Social Cognitive Perspective"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Harris_wmed_0261F_10014.pdf|"counselor education, family, multicultural, partnerships, school counseling, social cognitive"|"School-family partnerships facilitate the academic and personal success of all students. Whereas forming these partnerships are a component of school counselor identity, school counselors are commonly unprepared to form and maintain such relationships. Additionally, shifting racial demographics within K-12 schools call for culturally responsive partnership-building, as the majority of school counselors continue to belong to the dominant culture. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of school counselors as it relates to involvement in partnerships with families of color. Using a social cognitive theoretical framework, this study solicited a national sample of 155 practicing school counselors to examine self-efficacy, multicultural competence, and environment with regards to forming these diverse partnerships. The School Counselor Self-Efficacy (SCSE) scale, the Multicultural Counseling Competence and Training Survey-Revised (MCCTS-R), and a modified version of the School Counselor Involvement in Partnerships Survey (SCIPS) were used to examine these characteristics. The results of this study indicated significantly positive relationships between self-efficacy, multicultural competence, and involvement in partnerships with families of color. However, only self-efficacy as it relates specifically to partnerships and multicultural knowledge served as significant predictors of involvement in these partnerships. Further, receiving previous coursework in multicultural counseling or family-related content did not make any significant differences in involvement. The outcomes suggest that school counselors may benefit from more practical experiences in diverse settings to encourage involvement in partnerships with families of color. Findings also support the integration of the social cognitive theoretical concept of triadic reciprocal determinism into training curricula.

"New Teacher Induction: A Program Evaluation"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org/etds/Hunter_wmed_0261F_10015.pdf|"Independent School, Induction, New Teacher"|"The purpose of this qualitative program evaluation was to examine the impact a two-year new teacher induction program had on teachers’ feelings of support, satisfaction, and self-efficacy.  The program purports that higher feelings of support, satisfaction, and self-efficacy in teachers will lead to lower teacher attrition.  In turn, research shows that if teachers stay at a school they are more likely to improve their instruction and positively impact student performance.  The goal of the study was to identify areas of the induction program that work well in increasing teachers perceptions positively in the three focus areas and to look for ways to improve the program moving forward to better serve future new hires at the school. Data were gathered through an interview process with ten questions focusing on the three main research areas of support, satisfaction, and self-efficacy.  Participants included the eight teachers that had most recently completed the two-year induction program.  The teachers reported feeling high levels of support, satisfaction, and self-efficacy following their two years at the school, but the impact the induction program had on those levels was mixed.  A number of non-induction related activities were identified that also impact the teachers’ levels in the three focus areas.  Recommendations were made to strengthen identified areas of induction already in place that were important to the participants as well as additions that could be added to the induction program in order to maximize the effectiveness of the program.

This study uses autoethnography to examine the psychological impact of my own traumatic experience in relation to my graduate student experience. I rely on personal narrative layered with theoretical literature on posttraumatic growth processes (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004) to illustrate the power of trauma in redefining my internal schema within the graduate student experience. Posttraumatic Growth (PTG) requires that an individual cognitively process and make new meaning from traumatic experiences. In this autoethnography, I share and examine my personal story of trauma and how I made sense of those experiences, both as an individual and within the context of my graduate program. Wisdom from trauma revealed recommendations for graduate students experiencing trauma and their faculty. For faculty, helping students process and develop posttraumatic growth requires (a) balancing support and challenge, (b) establishing open and personal communication with graduate students, (c) embracing vulnerability, (d) supporting the decisions students make following traumatic experience, and (e) being present in the journey toward growth. Wisdom for graduate students experiencing trauma include (a) knowing that it is okay to share their experiences, (b) realizing that life and school are not separate, (c) understanding that processing takes time and space, and (d) identifying trustworthy outlets to practice self-disclosure. This autoethnography further shares implications for institutional policy, advocates for using PTG as a developmental process within graduate programs, and emphasizes the value of sharing stories.

Based on the outcomes, decisions will be made to determine if the environment is inclusive or needs to be revisited to encourage family involvement. Participants included the 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 grade families at An Achievable Dream Academy and An Achievable Dream Middle and High School in Newport News, Virginia. The study used the CIPP model of program evaluation to guide data collect on the context, input, process, and products of the parent involvement program. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected using parent surveys, focus groups, home and school documents, and behavior, attendance, and SOL data.  The study illuminated the successes and challenges of the program as well as areas of recommended improvement. The results indicated that there was a high level of parent involvement but it did not greatly impact the students’ success. With ongoing program monitoring and evaluation, the program can overcome these challenges and make recommended changes that will result in increased successes for the school and students. Recommendations for future research and program improvement include conducting a comparison study on AAD and a similar program, identifying what factors impact student success, and understanding the factors impacting teacher resistance.

These factors are observed primarily within the timeframe of 1954-1966.  The Virginia Community College System (VCCS) evolved from the Technical College System, and began in 1964.  Classes started at the first technical colleges in September 1965.  Despite the writings of two previous histories concerning the founding of the VCCS, one in 1977 and another in 1987, the events that led to the creation of the technical college system have never been documented, nor have the linkages between the technical college system and the Virginia’s business and industry community been investigated.  Pointedly, the influence of the series of events, beginning with the Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954 and the subsequent Massive Resistance movement in Virginia, created a particular climate for the founding of the Department of Technical Education 10 years later.  The research questions at the heart of this study sought to understand better the social, political, and economic circumstances under which the colleges were formed.  This research used oral history methods and documentary research methods to create a historiographic overview of the founding of the VTCS.  This research determined that the contested environment of Massive Resistance contributed to the founding of the VTCS.

Education professionals are in a unique position to begin this process by referring the student to school specialists for evaluation. However, diagnostic confusion surrounding autism, misconceptions about special education, varying conceptions of giftedness, and overlapping behaviors of giftedness and ASD can inhibit education professionals’ ability to recognize unique behaviors of gifted students with ASD, and make appropriate referrals, placing the student at academic risk. Autism and giftedness have been studied separately in the fields of education and psychology for more than half a century. Although the study of giftedness with ASD has begun to increase in recent years, no empirical study to date has focused on education professionals who successfully referred this student population for specialized services. The present mixed methods study examined perceptions and experiences of education professionals who successfully referred gifted students with ASD for specialized services. Survey research probed training, experience, and credentials, as well as perceptions about twice exceptionality. Semi-structured interviews investigated observed behaviors prompting their student’s referral for specialized services, experiences with their gifted students with ASD, and evidence they found influential in identifying their student as gifted. These elements combined to provide not only a conceptualization of the gifted student with ASD, but a conception of the education professional who worked with them. The results of this study will inform research, pre-service coursework, and professional development in meeting the needs of this special population of gifted student.

Emphasis on art experiences and skills is missing in school programs, due to financial and accountability constraints, and encouraging prioritization on “core” subjects. Rural environments present particular challenges: while they are identified as fertile ground for developing a creative class, low population density makes it difficult to provide substantial support for in-depth exploratory, experiential creative endeavors.  	A crucial element of maintaining personal commitment to one’s talent area is support. While support from the family is essential, the value a community (which includes the school) places on any talent domain largely impacts the individual developmental trajectory for that talent—especially in teenagers. This study was conducted to explore the perceptions of individual talent among artistically gifted adolescents in rural communities in the U.S., and concluded that immediate and extended families provided adequate levels of support for the adolescents to remain committed to their talent and that a critical factor associated with school and community support is missing: the time necessary to devote to development of that talent. 	The study offers the opportunity to open a dialogue related to research on the marginalization of visual thinkers (of which the artistically gifted are a sub-group); to apply the findings to the current climate in education; and to establish collaborative efforts to promote artistic talent development in answer to the demand for art and design thinking, innovation, and creativity on a global scale.
