"Characterization Of Interfacial Interactions By Functionalized Afm Probes"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Dickinson_wmgrad_0261E_10005.pdf|"Interfacial interactions play a crucial role in many complex materials systems, determining many of their properties. However, characterization of these interactions, especially at the micro- to nanometer length scales is experimentally challenging. Consequently, insufficient knowledge of these systems limits technological advances in important applications. In this work, custom functionalized atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes were developed to measure the interaction forces in two important systems: petroleum reservoirs and nanocomposites. Our work seeks a deeper understanding of the specific interactions that occur in these two systems so that modified approaches can be developed to improve them. Petroleum recovery is concerned with maximizing the collection of crude oil, which adheres to rock surfaces underground and resists release when flushed with injection water. To promote more efficient oil extraction, the injection water can be tailored to decrease this oil–rock adhesion. In our study of petroleum recovery, we coated a probe in crude oil and dried the oil to create a robust layer. By performing force measurements with this probe on a mica substrate and varying the surrounding aqueous composition, we observed the effect of multiple variables on the relevant forces in a reservoir, ultimately providing enhanced predictive capabilities for increased oil extraction in injection wells. To achieve a graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite with optimal properties requires a strong bond between the nanofiller particles and surrounding polymer matrix. To this end, we studied the interactions within a GO–polymer nanocomposite by coating a probe in GO flakes and performing force measurements on polymer substrates. The preferential attraction between GO and some polymers is consistent with the results of recent interfacial tests performed in our lab. Our research provides crucial information for the selection of novel GO–polymer combinations, which can be implemented in superior reinforced nanocomposite systems. Through development of these novel tools, we anticipate that our customized probes will enhance predictive capabilities in the study of colloidal and other interfacial systems.

"Investigating Proton Spin Structure: A Measurement Of G_2^p At Low Q^2"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Cummings_wmgrad_0261E_10007.pdf|"The $g_2^p$ collaboration performed the first measurement of the reaction $\vec{p}(\vec{e},e')X$ in the kinematic range 0.02 $<$ Q$^2$ $<$ 0.2 GeV$^2$ in the resonance region.  Experiment E08-027 took place in Hall A at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility from March-May of 2012.   Data was taken with a longitudinally polarized electron beam, using an NH$_3$ target polarized in both parallel and perpendicular configurations.  Very preliminary results for $g_1^p$ and $g_2^p$ are shown in this thesis.   To extract the spin structure functions, asymmetries are calculated from data taken with a 2.2 GeV electron beam and a 5 T target field, and combined with the Bosted model proton cross section.  Preliminary dilution factors and preliminary radiative corrections are included in the asymmetry analysis.  Sum rules and $\chi$PT allow us to test the Burkhardtt-Cottingham (BC) sum rule and obtain the spin polarizability quantities $\gamma_0$ and $\delta_{LT}$.  The BC sum rule, valid for all values of $Q^2$, says that the integral of $g_2$ over all Bjorken $x$ vanishes.  The very preliminary result presented here shows the contribution to the integral from the measured kinematic region.  Although the contribution from the resonance region is not consistent with the expected result of zero, an extrapolation to high and low $x$ must be included to test whether the BC sum rule is satisfied.  The difficulty in $\chi$PT calculations of $\gamma_0$ and $\delta_{LT}$ is how to include the resonance contributions, particularly the $\Delta$-resonance, which dominates.  Recent developments have found better agreement with neutron experimental results, however this is little proton data to compare with the calculations, particularly at low $Q^2$.  The very preliminary results shown here do not show agreement with any of the current $\chi$PT predictions.  However, as this is only the contribution from the measured kinematic region, it is necessary to include the extrapolation outside the resonance region to draw a stronger conclusion.  Further analysis is ongoing, and preliminary results, including a cross section extracted from data instead of a model prediction, are expected within the next year.

"Enhancing The Sensing Capabilities Of Mobile And Embedded Systems"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Graham_wmgrad_0261E_10008.pdf|"In this work, we aim to develop new sensors and sensing platforms that facilitate the development of new mobile and embedded devices. Mobile and embedded devices have become an integral part of our everyday lives and the sensing capabilities of these devices have improved throughout the years. Developing new and innovative sensors and sensing platforms will provide the building blocks for developing new sensing systems. In an effort to facilitate these innovations we have developed two new in-air sonar sensors and a new reconfigurable sensing platform. The first in-air sonar sensor is designed for ranging applications and uses the phone's microphone and rear speaker to generate a wide beam of sound. The second in-air sonar sensor is an external module which uses a narrow beam of sound for high resolution ranging. This ranging information is then combined with orientation data from the phone's gyroscope,magnetometer and accelerometer to generate a two dimensional map of a space. While researching ways of enhancing the sensing capabilities of mobile and embedded devices, we found that the process often requires developing new hardware prototypes. However, developing hardware prototypes is time-consuming. In an effort to lower the barrier to entry for small teams and software researchers, we have developed a new reconfigurable sensing platform that uses a code first approach to embedded design. Instead of designing software to run within the limited constraints of the hardware, our proposed code-first approach allows software researchers to synthesize the hardware configuration that is required to run their software.

"Neurometric Profiling Of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using The Brief Neurometric Battery: A Novel Eeg Based Task"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Gayle_wmgrad_0261N_10011.pdf|"Autism spectrum disorder is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. Due to the dramatic increase in prevalence, a major theme in contemporary research has been the identification of biomarkers for ASD that can shed light on etiological factors, facilitate diagnosis and serve as markers for tracking the efficacy of behavioral and pharmacological treatments. Electroencephalography (EEG) metrics, such as event-related potentials (ERPs), resting state oscillatory activity (OA), and resting state complexity (multiscale entropy), are well-suited for the measurement of such biomarkers. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD symptoms, it is important that research aiming to use EEG to identify biomarkers of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders focus on determining the relationships between electrophysiological neurometrics and clinical presentation. The objective of the present research was two-fold; 1) synthesize a profile of ERP and OA metrics, collected during a novel Brief Neurometric Battery, that differentiates between youth with ASD and controls, and 2) determine if a relatively novel analysis of resting state EEG complexity (MSE) can be used to differentiate between ASD and controls. Through a two study approach, this research was able to synthesize a multivariate profile that classified youth with and without ASD at an accuracy rate comparable to that of the gold standard methods (ADI-R/ADOS) and identify an additional neurometric, multiscale entropy, that can accurately differentiate between youth with ASD and controls.

"Muskogee Internationalism In An Age Of Revolution, 1763-1818"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Hill_wmgrad_0261E_10012.pdf|"This dissertation reevaluates the consequences of the American Revolution by examining how indigenous peoples preserved their role as regional powers in the decades following the birth of the United States. Focusing on the Creek Indians of the present-day southeastern United States, I demonstrate that they maintained ties with Britons, Spaniards, and other Native peoples, employing these connections to their advantage. Creeks created borderlands that connected their societies with those of the British and Spanish Caribbean. The Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of Florida and their surrounding waters became zones of encounter and exchange between Native peoples, British wreckers from the Bahamas, and Spanish fishermen from Cuba. The networks created through these borderlands show that many elements of colonial-era diplomacy, where Native peoples held significant power in relationships with Europeans and Euroamericans, continued in force well after American independence. Creek diplomacy during this era engaged with European international law and concepts of nationhood in ways that compare to and were in dialogue with the efforts of the United States. Both Creeks and Americans sought to negotiate as unitary nations because the international order of their era demanded it. Each consisted of disparate peoples who had little sense of common interest or cohesion prior to the mid-eighteenth century. Creeks identified as members of towns and clans rather than as a singular nation. Any political unity between the Creek towns developed only in response to challenges presented by European colonization. Likewise, Americans identified more with their home states or local communities than the nation as a whole. Over the course of the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, both Creeks and Americans struggled to find ways to balance local interests with the diplomatic needs created by the Atlantic community to which they belonged. In this sense, Creek diplomacy was decidedly modern and conversant with legal and political developments throughout the Atlantic world.

"Methods For Estimating The Diagonal Of Matrix Functions"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Laeuchli_wmgrad_0261E_10014.pdf|"Many applications such as path integral evaluation in Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD), variance estimation of least square solutions and spline ts, and centrality measures in network analysis, require computing the diagonal of a function of a matrix, Diag(f(A)) where A is sparse matrix, and f is some function. Unfortunately, when A is large, this can be computationally prohibitive. Because of this, many applications resort to Monte Carlo methods. However, Monte Carlo methods tend to converge slowly. One method for dealing with this shortcoming is probing. Probing assumes that nodes that have a large distance between them in the graph of A, have only a small weight connection in f(A). To determine the distances between nodes, probing forms Ak. Coloring the graph of this matrix will group nodes that have a high distance between them together, and thus a small connection in f(A). This enables the construction of certain vectors, called probing vectors, that can capture the diagonals of f(A). One drawback of probing is in many cases it is too expensive to compute and store A^k for the k that adequately determines which nodes have a strong connection in f(A). Additionally, it is unlikely that the set of probing vectors required for A^k is a subset of the probing vectors needed for Ak+1. This means that if more accuracy in the estimation is required, all previously computed work must be discarded. In the case where the underlying problem arises from a discretization of a partial dierential equation (PDE) onto a lattice, we can make use of our knowledge of the geometry of the lattice to quickly create hierarchical colorings for the graph of A^k. A hierarchical coloring is one in which colors for A^{k+1} are created by splitting groups of nodes sharing a color in A^k. The hierarchical property ensures that the probing vectors used to estimate Diag(f(A)) are nested subsets, so if the results are inaccurate the estimate can be improved without discarding the previous work. If we do not have knowledge of the intrinsic geometry of the matrix, we propose two new classes of methods that improve on the results of probing. One method seeks to determine structural properties of the matrix f(A) by obtaining random samples of the columns of f(A). The other method leverages ideas arising from similar problems in graph partitioning, and makes use of the eigenvectors of f(A) to form effective hierarchical colorings. Our methods have thus far seen successful use in computational physics, where they have been applied to compute observables arising in LQCD. We hope that the renements presented in this work will enable interesting applications in many other elds.

"Selling Race In America: Ideologies Of Labor, Color, And Social Order In Nineteenth- And Twentieth-Century Advertising Imagery"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Bryant_wmgrad_0261E_10015.pdf|"Scholars have studied American advertising in terms of collectible Americana, histories of printing technology, and consumer culture. These approaches leave a gap in our understanding of American advertising in terms of its role as a powerful carrier of ideological value and a critical participant in national discourses on race and American identity. My study examines nineteenth- and twentieth-century advertising imagery and visual culture—including postcards, prints, and other related ephemera—reading such images as conscious commentary on contemporary racial, social, and economic issues. I employ traditional art historical methods to examine advertising imagery and ephemera, bridging the fields of labor, food, health, and race studies to generate a complex discussion of the myriad stereotypes employed to oppress and limit African Americans’ participation in the American dream. I argue that stereotype comprised a potent method—technologically and ideologically—of identifying and qualifying humanity and “Americanness.” Bred by pseudoscience and propagated throughout the first half of the twentieth century, in particular, stereotypes targeting African Americans argued for their supposed inherent backwardness, inferiority, and suitability for the labors and livelihoods considered unsuitable for white Americans. Picturing black figures in American advertising and visual culture as out-of-control, insatiable, unclean, inexhaustible, and nostalgic bodies created a salve for white anxieties concerning the increasing opportunities afforded black Americans socially, politically, and economically. By closely reading advertising cards, postcards, prints, and other related ephemera as contributors to national discourses on race, I shed new light on their creation, use, and dissemination as powerful tools for selling ideologies about human value, identity, and participation in American life.

"Understanding Security Threats In Cloud"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Xu_wmgrad_0261E_10018.pdf|"As cloud computing has become a trend in the computing world, understanding its security concerns  becomes essential for improving service quality and expanding business scale. This dissertation studies the security issues in a public cloud from three aspects. First, we investigate a new threat called power attack in the cloud. Second, we perform a systematical measurement on the public cloud to understand how cloud vendors react to existing security threats. Finally, we propose a novel technique to perform data reduction on audit data to improve system capacity, and hence helping to enhance security in cloud. In the power attack, we exploit various attack vectors in platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) cloud environments. To demonstrate the feasibility of launching a power attack, we conduct series of testbed based experiments and data-center-level simulations. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis on how different power management methods could affect a power attack and how to mitigate such an attack. Our experimental results and analysis show that power attacks will pose a serious threat to modern data centers and should be taken into account while deploying new high-density servers and power management techniques. In the measurement study, we mainly investigate how cloud vendors have reacted to the co-residence threat inside the cloud, in terms of Virtual Machine (VM) placement, network management, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Specifically, through intensive measurement probing, we first profile the dynamic environment of cloud instances inside the cloud. Then using real experiments, we quantify the impacts of VM placement and network management upon co-residence, respectively. Moreover, we explore VPC, which is a defensive service of Amazon EC2 for security enhancement, from the routing perspective. Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a serious cyber-threat, cloud vendors are seeking solutions to ``connect the suspicious dots'' across multiple activities. This requires ubiquitous system auditing for long period of time, which in turn causes overwhelmingly large amount of system audit logs. We propose a new approach that exploits the dependency among system events to reduce the number of log entries while still supporting high quality forensics analysis. In particular, we first propose an aggregation algorithm that preserves the event dependency in data reduction to ensure high quality of forensic analysis. Then we propose an aggressive reduction algorithm and exploit domain knowledge for further data reduction. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on real world auditing systems using more than one-month log traces to validate the efficacy of our approach.

"Enhancing Mobile Device System Using Information From Users And Upper Layers"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/NguyenTien_wmgrad_0261E_10019.pdf|"Despite the rapid hardware upgrades, a common complaint among smartphone owners is the poor battery life. To many users, being required to charge the smartphone after a single day of moderate usage is unacceptable. Moreover, current smartphones suffer various unpredictable delays during operation, e.g., when launching an app, leading to poor user experience. In this dissertation, we provide solutions that enhance systems on portable devices using information obtained from their users and upper layers on the I/O path. First, we provide an experimental study on how storage I/O path upper layers affect power levels in smartphones, and introduce energy-efficient approaches to reduce energy consumption facilitating various usage patterns. At each layer, we investigate the amount of energy that can be saved, and use that to design and implement a prototype with optimal energy savings named SmartStorage. We evaluate our prototype by using the 20 most popular Android applications, and our energy-efficient approaches achieve from 23% to 52% of energy savings compared to using the current techniques. Next, we conduct the first large-scale user study on the I/O delay of Android using the data collected from our Android app running on 2611 devices within nine months. Among other factors, we observe that reads experience up to 626% slowdown when blocked by concurrent writes for certain workloads. We use this obtained knowledge to design a system called SmartIO that reduces application delays by prioritizing reads over writes. SmartIO is evaluated extensively on several groups of popular applications. The results show that our system reduces launch delays by up to 37.8%, and run-time delays by up to 29.6%. Finally, we study the impact of memory on smartphone user-perceived performance. Our heap usage investigation of 20 popular applications indicates that rich multimedia applications have high heap usage and go above allowed boundaries, up to 5.63 times more heap than guaranteed by the system, and may cause crashes and erroneous behaviors. Moreover, limited heap may not only cause an app to crash, but may even prevent an app from launching. Therefore, we present iRAM, a system that maintains optimal heap size limits to avoid crashes, efficiently maximizes free memory levels, and cleans low-priority processes to reduce application delays. The evaluation indicates that iRAM reduces application crashes by up to 14 percent.

"Optical Characterization Of Interface Magnetization In Multifunctional Oxide Heterostructures"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Fang_wmgrad_0261E_10020.pdf|"Multifunctional oxides attract much attention recently. The strong correlated electron system involves the notable properties of colossal magnetoresistance, ferroelectric tunneling and spin transport, with the coupling of electron, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Their rich functional behavior is of potential use for nanoelectronics and data storage. Particularly interesting are the mulitferroic materials, which exhibit simultaneously electric and magnetic ordering properties. Understanding the interface coupling mechanism of these two order parameters are critical to future development of high-performance spintronic devices. The goal of this dissertation is to elucidate the interfacial magnetoelectric (ME) coupling with optical characterization method -- magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG), which is sensitive to the interface due to the broken spatial inversion symmetry. First, ME coupling at the interface of BaTiO3 (BTO)/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) is observed by applying an external electric field. The voltage-dependent magnetic contrast reveals a sharp transition from ferromagnetic (FM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) order occurring at positive voltage (applied to LSMO contact). This novel effect is attributed to interface ME coupling. Strain or ferroelectric (FE) polarization induced mechanisms do not play an important role in this system. A new mechanism is proposed -- minority spin injection -- to modulate the interface magnetization. The minority spin injection at the interface weakens the double-exchange coupling of nearby eg electrons, thereby weakening the FM ordering. Thus the dominant AFM superexchange coupling of localized t2g electrons causes the phase transition at positive voltage. The magnetic transition is shifted to higher voltage by reducing the carrier concentration of BTO.  Second, a non-multiferroic heterostructure -- SrTiO3 (STO)/La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 (LCMO)/La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) -- is studied to elucidate further the interface ME effect. The magnetization transition is observed but shifted to negative voltage. The LSMO is pushed to higher hole doping level due to the STO layer which acts as a hole donating layer, while the LCMO interlayer at the medium doping level displays complicated CE-type AFM phase. Thus, a negative voltage is required to lower the hole doping level of LSMO to induce the FM phase. The magnetic contrast reappears at high positive voltage, indicating the occurrence of an A-type AFM phase, which is stable at high hole doping concentration. The results of this dissertation show that the interface magnetic phase of LSMO can be controlled by an applied electric field through modulation of the hole doping level.

"Security Supports For Cyber-Physical System And Its Communication Networks"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Qin_wmgrad_0261E_10021.pdf|"A cyber-physical system (CPS) is a sensing and communication platform that features tight integration and combination of computation, networking, and physical processes. In such a system, embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes through a feedback loop, in which physical processes affect computations and vice versa. In recent years, CPS has caught much attention in many different aspects of research, such as security and privacy. In this dissertation, we focus on supporting security in CPS and its communication networks. First, we investigate the electric power system, which is an important CPS in modern society. As crucial and valuable infrastructure, the electric power system inevitably becomes the target of malicious users and attackers. In our work, we point out that the electric power system is vulnerable to potential cyber attacks, and we introduce a new type of attack model, in which an attack cannot be completely identified, even though its presence may be detected. To defend against such an attack, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm to narrow down the attack region, and then enumerate all feasible attack scenarios. Furthermore, based on the feasible attack scenarios, we design an optimization strategy to minimize the damage caused by the attack. Next, we study cognitive radio networks, which are a typical communication network in CPS in the areas of security and privacy. As for the security of cognitive radio networks, we point out that a prominent existing algorithm in cooperative spectrum sensing works poorly under a certain attack model. In defense of this attack, we present a modified combinatorial optimization algorithm that utilizes the branch-and-bound method in a decision tree to identify all possible false data efficiently. In regard to privacy in cognitive radio networks, we consider incentive-based cognitive radio transactions, where the primary users sell time slices of their licensed spectrum to secondary users in the network. There are two concerns in such a transaction. The first is the primary user's interest, and the second is the secondary user's privacy. To verify that the payment made by a secondary user is trustworthy, the primary user needs detailed spectrum utilization information from the secondary user. However, disclosing this detailed information compromises the secondary user's privacy. To solve this dilemma, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme by repeatedly using a commitment scheme and zero-knowledge proof scheme.

"The Role Of Impulsivity In Dietary Restraint And Counter-Regulation"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Zhuang_wmgrad_0261N_10023.pdf|"Dietary restraint, or chronically controlling one's weight through diet, is a difficult pursuit. When faced with tempting foods, only a minority of restrained eaters manage to regulate their intake. Impulsivity, a multidimensional construct implicated in addictive behaviors, may be a factor that predicts regulation. The goals of the current study were twofold: firstly, we examined the effect of consuming a diet-violating preload on state impulsivity, and secondly, we examined how dietary restraint and changes in state impulsivity interact to influence subsequent overeating. In a laboratory study, female participants (n=146) with differing levels of dietary restraint provided measures of their state impulsiveness before and after consuming a 16oz preload of either a milkshake (High Calorie group) or water (Control group). The two state impulsivity subtypes assessed were inhibitory control, measured using the Stop Signal Task (SST), and food-specific impulsive choice, measured using a modified Delay Discounting Task. Results showed that after consuming a preload, all participants showed decreases in food-specific impulsive choice but not in inhibitory control. For those in the milkshake condition who were high in dietary restraint, higher initial inhibitory control and larger decreases in food-specific impulsive choice predicted lower subsequent caloric intake. No effects of impulsivity on consumption were seen for participants in the Control condition. These results suggest that subtypes of state impulsivity play differential roles in the eating behaviors of restrained eaters, and highlight important predictors of counter-regulation. Understanding the causal pathway between restraint and counter-regulation informs future directions in creating healthy eating interventions.

The uncertainties associated with the production and attenuation of the hadrons in the beamline materials along with those associated with the beam optics have a big effect in the flux spectrum knowledge. For experiments like MINERvA, understanding the flux is crucial since it enters directly into every neutrino-nucleus cross-section measurements. The foundation of this work is predicting the neutrino flux at MINERvA using dedicated measurements of hadron production in hadron-nucleus collisions and incorporating in-situ MINERvA data that can provide additional constraints. This work also includes the prospect for predicting the flux at other detectors like the NOvA Near. The procedure and conclusions of this thesis will have a big impact on future hadron production experiments and on determining the flux for the upcoming DUNE experiment.

It begins with an overview of historical and contemporary models of political economy among Native groups in the pre-contact and pre-settlement era Northeast, emphasizing the importance of neo-evolutionary anthropology as an instructive corollary to more traditional functionalist and evolutionary theories of Native political economy. Special emphasis is placed on passages from classical ethnographic sources that gesture towards coercive and meaningful inequality within Algonquian societies. Subsequently, the relationship between usufruct forms of property ownership, territorial sovereignty, and kinship is analyzed in detail. Focus is placed on the historiographic tension created by the ownership of resource use-rights by multiple kinship lineages and the simultaneous possession of territorial sovereignty by Algonquian polities. Attention is then turned towards the early colonial New England context and the incorporation of Eastern Long Island Algonquians into the nascent English tributary chiefdom following the Pequot War. Focus is placed on the particular connection between sovereign authority and the preeminence of a single lineage of sachems among Eastern Long Island Algonquians, who ruled over a cohesive polity known as the Paumanack (""Land of Tribute""). Turning towards the English settlement of Long Island, it is argued that the planting of English colonists proceeded as Long Island sachems surrendered partial use-rights over those resources least essential for the reproduction of their authority. Confronted directly is the notion that English settlers and Algonquian sachems misunderstood one another's concepts of property ownership from within a usufruct/fee-simple binary. An emphasis is placed on conceptualizing English 'property' acquisitions, and those resources retained by the Long Island Algonquians after 1636, as necessarily limited due to the English Empire's overarching demand for sovereignty. The work concludes with an analysis of coercion within the Paumanack and local customs of lineage and inheritance, which are argued to be cognatic with a preference for patrlineage.

"Floristic Change Spanning 45 Years Of Global Change In The College Woods, Williamsburg, Va"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Cyrus_wmgrad_0261N_10029.pdf|"The College Woods, located in Williamsburg, VA, is a natural preserve of approximately 960 acres owned by the College of William & Mary.  The Woods supports a relatively diverse flora in a mature coastal-plain forest which has been under long-term biological study by members of the College.  This thesis contributes to the ongoing investigation of the Woods by documenting floristic and vegetation changes that have occurred over the last 45 years amidst a rising and uncontrolled white-tailed deer population.  Three main research questions are addressed: (1) How has floristic diversity, composition, and species abundance changed since the last floristic survey in 1989? (2) Under the assumption of chronic browse by white-tailed deer, are there species-specific plant traits that associate with a suite of declining species? and (3) What is the estimated forest successional trajectory indicated by a 2015 quantitative analysis of the diversity, composition, importance, and browse rates in 19 long-term permanent plots? For the floristic analysis, 297% more effort was required in 2015 to find 7% fewer species than in the last floristic survey of 1989, indicating a decline in the abundance of populations, making their rediscovery more difficult.  Over the last 45 years, 745 vascular plant species have been documented in the Woods. One hundred and twenty-six species were newly reported in 2015, while 196 previously-reported species were not relocated.  The turnover of species is consistent with the species-time relationship and was especially prominent in early successional open habitats.  Assessments of changes in relative abundance showed that 46% of the species had declined in abundance.  This appears to be driven by an overabundant white-tailed deer population, but no plant trait previously hypothesized to confer vulnerability to browse by white-tailed deer showed a signficant association with the set of declining species.  It is hypothesized that because the deer population has been overabundant for 20 years, any trait-based associations that may have once existed would have become obscured over time as browse intolerant species were reduced and deer switched to less-preffered plant material.  Deer-browse data on less preferred plants such as Fagus grandifolia, Polystichum acrosticoides and Ilex americana supports this hypothesis.  Nineteen permanent plots erected in 2003 were sampled for vegetation analysis immediately after Hurricane Isabel in 2004 and then resampled in 2015.  Analysis showed little change in the large tree and small tree size classes, but there was significant change in the sapling size class.  In the sapling size class, average stem density and species diversity significantly decreased between 2004 and 2015, or did not show the expected regeneration patterns in areas severely hit by the hurricane.  An analysis of deer browse in these plots showed that nearly 60% of all vegetation was browsed.  This is expected to slow down the rate of succession and alter forest composition, possibly resulting in a beech-dominated forest with very little understory. A management plan designed to allow the flora of the College Woods to recover from chronic deer browse was written and recommends controlling the white-tailed deer population through yearly managed hunts.

"Protecting Web Contents Against Persistent Crawlers"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Wan_wmgrad_0261N_10030.pdf|"Web crawlers have been developed for several malicious purposes like downloading server data without permission from website administrator. Armored stealthy crawlers are evolving against new anti-crawler mechanisms in the arms race between the crawler developers and crawler defenders. In this paper, we develop a new anti-crawler mechanism called PathMarker to detect and constrain crawlers that crawl content of servers stealthy and persistently. The basic idea is to add a marker to each web page URL and then encrypt the URL and marker. By using the URL path and user information contained in the marker as the novel features of machine learning, we could accurately detect stealthy crawlers at the earliest stage. Besides effectively detecting crawlers, PathMarker can also dramatically suppress the efficiency of crawlers before they are detected by misleading the crawlers visiting same page's URL with different markers. We deploy our approach on a forum website to collect normal users' data. The evaluation results show that PathMarker can quickly capture all 12 open-source and in-house crawlers, plus two external crawlers (i.e., Googlebots and Yahoo Slurp).

"Workload Interleaving With Performance Guarantees In Data Centers"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Yan_wmgrad_0261E_10031.pdf|"In the era of global, large scale data centers residing in clouds, many applications and users share the same pool of resources for the purposes of reducing energy and operating costs, and of improving availability and reliability. Along with the above benefits, resource sharing also introduces performance challenges: when multiple workloads access the same resources concurrently, contention may occur and introduce delays in the performance of individual workloads. Providing performance isolation to individual workloads needs effective management methodologies. The challenges of deriving effective management methodologies lie in finding accurate, robust, compact metrics and models to drive algorithms that can meet different performance objectives while achieving efficient utilization of resources. This dissertation proposes a set of methodologies aiming at solving the challenging performance isolation problem in workload interleaving in data centers, focusing on both storage components and computing components. At the storage node level, we focus on methodologies for better interleaving user traffic with background workloads, such as tasks for improving reliability, availability, and power savings. More specifically, a scheduling policy for background workload based on the statistical characteristics of the system busy periods and a methodology that quantitatively estimates the performance impact of power savings are developed. At the storage cluster level, we consider methodologies on how to efficiently conduct work consolidation and schedule asynchronous updates without violating user performance targets. More specifically, we develop a framework that can estimate beforehand the benefits and overheads of each option in order to automate the process of reaching intelligent consolidation decisions while achieving faster eventual consistency. At the computing node level, we focus on improving workload interleaving at off-the-shelf servers as they are the basic building blocks of large-scale data centers. We develop priority scheduling middleware that employs different policies to schedule background tasks based on the instantaneous resource requirements of the high priority applications running on the server node. Finally, at the computing cluster level, we investigate popular computing frameworks for large-scale data intensive distributed processing, such as MapReduce and its Hadoop implementation. We develop a new Hadoop scheduler called DyScale to exploit capabilities offered by heterogeneous cores in order to achieve a variety of performance objectives.

"Density Dependence And Clonal Integration In Common Milkweed, Asclepias Syriaca"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Seward_wmgrad_0261N_10034.pdf|"The density of individuals in a population has the potential to affect growth and death rates of that population. This effect of density is called density dependence and can be negatively or positively related to a vital rate. In most populations, increasing density leads to lower growth rates, which is negative density dependence. Positive density dependence, or Allee effects, occurs when increasing density leads to an increase in a vital rate, such as increasing survival in large herds. However, in clonal plants, there is the potential for the effects of density to be ameliorated. Clonal plants produce genetically identical progeny and some maintain a physiological connection even after the progeny mature. Through this physical connection, resources may be shared through clonal integration and thus clonal plants ameliorate the effects of stressful environments by acting as one large plant, or a genet, rather than as many individuals. Asclepias syriaca, common milkweed, is a clonal species that maintains connections to its clonal progeny. Common milkweed has been a popular species of study because of its relationship with the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, and other specialist herbivores and because it is a pest plant in agriculture. In spite of this research, little is known about how individuals, or ramets, interact with one another. Understanding if ramets are integrated is key to furthering our understanding of how this species functions. My research on milkweed integration was conducted in two parts; a greenhouse experiment and a field study. The greenhouse experiment used pairs of milkweed to first determine if the defense chemicals of milkweed, known as cardenolides, are shared between damaged and undamaged ramets. A second portion of this experiment studied foliar concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon and how they varied between connected and unconnected ramets. The third portion of this study focused on integration in a stressful environment, shade. The field study used three years of data from 4 sites and 18 transects across the state of Virginia to determine how density changes across years and how that potentially changes the responses of the plants. Measures of survival, growth, reproduction, and herbivory were taken each year. These data were modeled with generalized mixed effects models to simultaneously take into account the effects of year, site, and transect on each plant response. These responses were predicted to follow patterns that would suggest integration, which could be seen as a lack of competition when it would normally be expected. In the cardenolide study, all ramets responded to the damage treatment, indicating a volatile signal of herbivory. The foliar trait study showed connected ramets may be better at taking up nitrogen than unconnected individuals. Biomass at the end of the shade experiment showed signs of competition in unconnected but not in connected ramets, indicating integration. In the field study density only affected survival, height, leaf area, growth, and the number of inflorescences. At the patch scale, increasing density decreased survival, height, leaf area, and the number of inflorescences. Growth was not affected by density at the patch scale, but at the small scale it decreased with increasing density. Survival and height also decreased with increasing density at the small scale. The number of inflorescences was not affected by density at the small scale.

"Factors Affecting Temporal Variation In Occupancy Of Two Common Species Of Butterflies In Woodlands Of The Eastern United States, Papilio Glaucus And Eurytides Marcellus."|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Zappalla_wmgrad_0261N_10035.pdf|"Identifying key factors of habitat quality and the extents at which they operate is invaluable to the understanding of the biology of a species. Key factors defining habitat quality for many common butterfly species have yet to be determined. Diverse methods are used to define habitat quality for butterflies. Some of these, such as mark-release-recapture or distance sampling, can be difficult to implement. Occupancy modeling is less invasive and generally less expensive than these other methods. Occupancy modeling is based on repeated presence-absence surveys. Occupancy is the probability that a species is present at a given site after accounting for imperfect detection. Detection is the probability that a species is detected given that it is present. The goal of this study was to identify factors at different spatial extents that are associated with occupancy, colonization (the probability that a site that was unoccupied in the previous time step is occupied in the current time step), and extinction (the probability that a site that was occupied in the previous time step is vacant in the current time step) of two common butterfly species in woodlands of the eastern United States, Eurytides marcellus and Papilio glaucus. For both species, the count and or proportion of host plants explained the greatest variation in occupancy. For E. marcellus, the greatest proportion of variation in probabilities of colonization and extinction was explained by the proportion of agricultural cover and the density of edges between forests and open-herbaceous areas and between forests and wetlands. The variables with which occupancy, colonization, and extinction of E. marcellus were most strongly associated were measured at extents from 90 m-5 km. Variables that explained the greatest variation in occupancy, colonization, and extinction of P. glaucus were measured over a smaller range of extents (540 m -3 km). Colonization was negatively associated with the proportion of open-herbaceous cover and the density of roads, suggesting that habitat quality for P. glaucus decreases as forest fragmentation increases. The proportion of wetland cover also had a consistent positive association with extinction of P. glaucus. This study suggests that colonization and extinction of P. glaucus and E. marcellus are associated with ecological processes and land use at extents of kilometers.

"Synthesis, Structure And Optical Memory Properties Of Copper (I) Thiocyanate Networks With Aromatic Amines, Diimines And Alkyl Sulfides"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Ayala_wmgrad_0261N_10036.pdf|"A series of CuSCN compounds were synthesized. Ligands included the alkyl sulfides methyl sulfide (Me2S), ethyl sulfide (Et2S), isopropyl sulfide (Pri2S) and tetrahydrothiophene (THT); diimine ligands pyrazine (Pyz), 2,3-dimethylpyrazine (2,3- Me2Pyz), 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-Me2Pyz), 2-aminopyrazine (2-NH2Pyz) and 2- methoxypyrazine (2-MeOPyz); two-ring diimines quinoxaline (Qox), quinazoline (Qnz), phthalazine (Ptz); and 3-halopyridines 3-chloropyridine (3-ClPy), 3-bromopyridine (3- BrPy), 3-iodopyridine (3-IPy). Crystal structures were solved for twelve products. With the exception of one Cu(II) compound, all could be classified in the common motifs of chains, ladders or sheets. Alkyl sulfides formed either 1:2 (CuSCN)L2 1-D chains (L = Me2S, 1a and THT, 4) or 1:1 (CuSCN)L2 1-D ladders (L = Et2S, 2 and Pri2S, 3) when reacted with CuSCN. New compounds of CuSCN with diimine ligands included two 2:1 (CuSCN)2LL 2-D bridged ladders (LL = Qox, 5 and 2-NH2Pyz, 8), two (CuSCN)L 1:1 2-D sheets (L = Qnz, 6 and 2-MeOPyz, 9) and one 1:1 (CuSCN)LL 2-D sheet (Ptz, 7). Structures of the known 1:2 (CuSCN)L2 compounds, where L = 3-ClPy (15a) or 3-BrPy (16) were solved as 1-D chains. Optical memory experiments sought to rapidly and significantly reduce the peak intensity in the ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) emission spectra of the synthesized compounds as a means of storing binary information. Fully emissive states were assigned as “unwritten,” while states with reduced emission were assigned as “written.” Samples were exposed to a high-energy tunable UV laser at 80 K for five minute intervals in order to affect emission intensities. Recovery capabilities were assessed by warming the samples to 298 K, allowing them to reach thermal equilibrium, and cooling them to 80 K before obtaining final scan. The known compounds (CuSCN)2LL, where LL= 2,3- dimethylpyrazine (2,3-Me2Pyz, 11), 2,5-dimethylpyrazine (2,5-Me2Pyz, 12) demonstrated reduced emission after irradiation, but suffered from fatigue after only one write/read/erase cycle. Compound 16 proved the most promising, displaying both significant emission depletion and complete recovery of initial intensity after three cycles. The x-ray crystal structure of 16 indicates numerous close carbon-bromine and sulfur- bromine interactions. Combined with computational calculations indicating an elongation of the pyridine C-Br bond in the most probable excited state, it is plausible that structural features play a role in the optical memory behavior of this compound.

"""dread Of Elder Titles"": John Haywood And The Occult Origins Of The Confederacy"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Wallace_wmgrad_0261E_10037.pdf|"This work unearths the dark work of John Haywood (1762–1826), an overlooked Tennessee historian and judge who provided foundational historical and legal arguments for the Confederate nation. Published in 1819, his apocalyptic Southern history, The Christian Advocate, simultaneously justified Indian Removal and simplified white Southerners’ claims of title to land. He thus became the first thinker to give Southerners a sense of place in the deep history of the South; the first to convince them they belonged where they lived. Andrew Jackson, for example, memorized passages from the Christian Advocate to convince himself: Southern Indians are the armies of Gog and Magog mentioned in the Book of Revelation; their ancestors massacred the mysterious, slaveholding mound-builders who inhabited the South prior to European contact; and they are waiting on the frontier to annihilate emerging Christian plantations in the young states of Mississippi and Alabama. While writing The Christian Advocate, Haywood used his position on the Tennessee Supreme Court to weave its logic into the property laws that became models for those of Mississippi and Alabama. His rulings assured planters that they should not “dread” violating “elder titles” in their sleep, or fear having some future judge determine they did not have a right to their land. By removing demonic Indian murderers, planters were restoring civilization to the Devil’s wilderness, an act that would bring about a New Jerusalem. By 1861, Haywood had given historians such as William Gilmore Simms and politicians such as Alexander Stephens something vital: historical arguments justifying the Confederate nation and its slaveholding theocracy. In overlooking Haywood and his influence, historians have missed a bizarre (to us) but nonetheless crucial link between historiography and the emergence of the Confederacy.

This thesis marshals archaeological, historiographic, and ethnohistorical data to use the excavations at the Rich Neck Plantation as a window into the diversity of the 17th century Atlantic world. An interpretation that highlights the composite nature of captive African communities is produced and juxtaposed against interpretations of the same archaeological artifacts and features through the landscape features and material culture of the English land owners. Tandem analysis of the archaeological record through the perspectives of these groups provides insight into the ways their perceptions of their surroundings overlapped and diverged.

They took full advantage of a stable Reconstruction regime and the advocates they found among local Republican reformers, northern missionary society representatives and Freedmen’s Bureau agents to make their freedom meaningful. The control the freedpeople gained over their labor, as well as the success they enjoyed in reclaiming their children from white households and establishing independent institutions assured their status as a free people rather than as emancipated dependents. Nor were the freedpeople plagued with persistent, organized white terrorist tactics. But they did not achieve equal treatment before the law. Moreover, despite the diversity of political sentiments among area whites, there was never a broad consensus among whites that the freedpeople should enjoy full citizenship equality. This study also explores how its regional distinctiveness and its borderland location influenced the course Reconstructing took in the Northern Valley. Based on the hundreds of complaints the freedpeople filed with the Valley’s Freedmen’s Bureau agents, the study also examines the ways in which their efforts to achieve racial progress on one front advanced their progress on other fronts.

"A Measurement Of The Parity-Violating Asymmetry In Aluminum And Its Contribution To A Measurement Of The Proton's Weak Charge"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Magee_wmgrad_0261E_10044.pdf|"The Qweak experiment, which ran at the Thomas Je↵erson National Accelerator Facility, made a precision measurement of the proton’s weak charge, Q_p^W . The weak charge is extracted via a measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry in elastic electron-proton scattering from hydrogen at low momentum transfer (Q^2=0.025 GeV^2). This result is directly related to the electroweak mixing angle, sin2 (theta_W ), a fundamental parameter in the Standard Model of particle physics. This provides a precision test sensitive to new, as yet unknown, fundamental physics. This dissertation focuses on two central corrections to the Qweak measurement: the target window contribution and sub-percent determination of the electron beam polarization. The aluminum target windows contribute approximately 30% of the measured asymmetry. Removal of this background requires precise measurements of both the elastic electron-aluminum scattering rate and its parity-violating asymmetry. The results reported here are the most precise measurement of the Qweak target dilution and asymmetry to date. The parity-violating asymmetry for the aluminum alloy was found to be 1.6174 ± 0.0704 (stat.) ± 0.0113 (sys.) parts-per-million. The first sub-percent precision polarization measurements made from the Hall C Møller polarimeter are also reported, with systematic uncertainties of 0.84%.

"Reproductive Altruism, Social Diversity And Host Association In Sponge-Dwelling Snapping Shrimps, Synalpheus"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Chak_vims_0261D_10000.pdf|"The diversity of animal social strategies has interested evolutionary biologists since the time of Darwin. Eusociality—the apex of animal sociality—traditionally characterized by cooperative offspring care, overlapping generations and reproductive division of labor, was until recently known only in insects and a few vertebrate species. The independent evolution of eusociality in shrimps in the genus Synalpheus offers a unique opportunity to test the generality of social evolution theories that are based mainly on insects and social vertebrates. The genus Synalpheus is particularly ideal for comparative analysis because their social organizations are highly diverse, yet they share very similar ecology of being sponge dwellers. Further, their close associations with sponges, in which many are considered microbial fermenters, allow one to test the ecological drivers of species diversity in Synalpheus. 	In this dissertation, I first explored the nature and consequences of reproductive altruism in eusocial species. Chapter 1 showed that workers in eusocial Synalpheus retain reproductive capability, but reproduction of female workers is suppressed by the queen. Chapter 2 showed further that such reproductive inequity among females within a colony leads to potentially strong competition among females for reproductive opportunities, and is associated with reduced sexual dimorphism in eusocial Synalpheus species. 	Second, I examined the evolutionary trajectories between and ecological advantages associated with different social organizations in Synalpheus. Chapter 3 shows that the two demographically distinct social organizations found in Synalpheus—communality and eusociality—have evolved via separate evolutionary trajectories and represent alternative social strategies. Chapter 4 further shows that these social strategies are associated with different aspects of ecological advantages conferred on Synalpheus living together. 	Finally, the intimate association with host sponges constrains the lifestyle of Synalpheus and may be one factor that has predisposed their evolution of eusociality. In Chapter 5, I examined the association pattern of Synalpheus with their host sponges and found that the symbiotic microorganisms in sponges, rather than the phylogenetic histories of the host sponges, are a better predictor and potential driver of the host association pattern. 	This dissertation has sought to test, and ended up challenging, several paradigms in ecology and evolution. My results suggest that 1) polymorphic reproductive soldiers may represent a natural transition towards eusociality, 2) reproductive monopolization can modulate the pattern of sexual dimorphism in social species, 3) communality and eusociality evolved from distinct trajectories and have different ecological advantages, and 4) symbiotic microorganisms may mediate biological interactions between their hosts and other organisms.

"Influence Of Structural Complexity And Location On The Habitat Value Of Restored Oyster Reefs"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Karp_vims_0261P_10002.pdf|"In the Chesapeake Bay, < 1% of the historic oyster population remains, and efforts have been increasing to restore oysters and the services they provide. Building reefs that successfully provide ecosystem services–especially habitat and foraging grounds–may require different restoration techniques than those previously used, and success may depend on reef morphology (complexity), location, and environmental conditions. Salinity and habitat complexity are two important factors that may interact to effect benthic communities and predator-prey interactions on restored reefs. The goals of this project were: (1) Characterize the benthic communities on restored oyster reefs in lower Chesapeake Bay, and (2) examine the effects of structural complexity and salinity on benthic communities and predator-prey interactions. A two-year field survey of restored reefs was carried out in four rivers in lower Chesapeake Bay to characterize faunal communities on restored reefs and to quantify the effect of reef complexity on faunal communities. A laboratory mesocosm experiment was conducted to examine the effect of reef complexity on predator foraging. In total, 61 macrofaunal species were identified among all samples, and restored reefs supported on average, 6,169 org/m2 and 67.88 g-AFDW/m2. There were significant differences in the community composition and diversity among the rivers, and salinity was the environmental factor that best explained the observed differences in species composition across the rivers. Salinity and rugosity (i.e., structural complexity) both positively affected diversity, while salinity negatively affected macrofaunal abundance and biomass. Oyster density and rugosity positively affected macrofaunal biomass, and oyster density positively affected mud crab, polychaete, and mussel densities. In the mesocosm experiment, predator foraging, measured by proportion and number of prey consumed, was significantly reduced in the presence of oyster shell structure. However, predators were able to consume more prey when prey density was increased, even in the presence of oyster shell structure. These results combine to enhance our understanding of the benefits of increased habitat complexity for both prey and predators on restored oyster reefs. Increasing complexity worked to increase the abundance, biomass, and diversity of organisms inhabiting restored reefs, and even though predator consumption was reduced in the presence of structure compared to non-structured habitat, predators were able to consume more prey individuals when prey density was increased. Therefore, increasing the structure of oyster reef habitat may benefit prey species by providing refuge habitat, and benefit predators by providing an increased abundance of available prey items.

"Alexandrium Monilatum In The Lower Chesapeake Bay: Sediment Cyst Distribution And Potential Health Impacts On Crassostrea Virginica"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Pease_vims_0261P_10005.pdf|"The toxin-producing harmful algal bloom (HAB) species Alexandrium monilatum has long been associated with finfish and shellfish mortalities in the Gulf of Mexico. In the summer of 2007, A. monilatum re-emerged as a bloom-forming species in the Chesapeake Bay. Over the last decade, late summer blooms of A. monilatum have been expanding in range in the lower Chesapeake Bay and have reached record-high densities, particularly in the lower York River. This dinoflagellate species overwinters in the sediments as a resting cyst, and upon excystment under suitable environmental conditions produces blooms the following summer. The research presented here includes the first mapping and quantification of resting cysts of A. monilatum in surface sediments in the Chesapeake Bay using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. A systematic grid sampling design was employed to collect pre-bloom sediments in the southwestern portion of the Chesapeake Bay each year from 2014-2016. Cysts were widespread in the bottom sediments and sediment cyst density increased from 2014-2016, reaching as high as 90,000 cysts/cc in the York River channel. A multiple linear regression was used to model cyst density using environmental parameters. Sediment type was a strong predictor of cyst density, with higher cyst densities found at sites with more fine sediments (silts and clays).   Laboratory HAB toxicity bioassay methods were used to investigate potential adverse health impacts of A. monilatum on adult triploid eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica. Oyster behavior and mortality were monitored and routine paraffin histology was performed to analyze tissue damage. Oysters did not exhibit mortality or tissue damage in a 48-hour fed toxicity bioassay. However, a 96-hour unfed toxicity bioassay led to 67% mortality, and erosion of the gill and mantle epithelial tissues in 94% of oysters exposed to A. monilatum (live cell or lysate). In the summer of 2015, oysters were deployed in the lower York River to assess effects of exposure before, during, and after a natural A. monilatum bloom. A subsample of six live oysters was collected weekly for two months and processed for histology. There was no mortality of deployed oysters, but minor epithelial erosion of the mantle was seen in half of the oysters sampled during the peak of the A. monilatum bloom from early to mid-August. Field and laboratory results showed that C. virginica did occasionally consume A. monilatum, and exposure of C. virginica to live A. monilatum or lysate could lead to epithelial erosion of external tissues and mortality.  It is clear from the findings of this research that A. monilatum has established itself in the York River region of the Chesapeake Bay and that at least under laboratory conditions, persistent exposure to A. monilatum (live or lysate) can have serious potential health impacts on adult oysters.

"Population Dynamics Of Gelatinous Zooplankton In The Chesapeake Bay And Sargasso Sea, And Effects On Carbon Export"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Stone_vims_0261D_10006.pdf|"Gelatinous zooplankton (GZ; cnidarians, ctenophores, and pelagic tunicates) periodically are the dominant members of the zooplankton throughout the majority of the world’s oceans.  Their unique body plans and life cycles allow them to rapidly take advantage of favorable environmental conditions, which has far-ranging consequences for food web dynamics and biogeochemical cycles.  GZ populations have been speculated to respond to anthropogenic changes, but few long-term studies exist to test this hypothesis and even fewer have examined the consequent effects on carbon export.  I analyzed two long-term time series in the Chesapeake Bay and one in the Sargasso Sea for annual and interannual changes in GZ populations and the environmental drivers of these changes.  I also conducted mesocosm experiments in the Chesapeake Bay and developed a carbon flux model for the Sargasso Sea to evaluate the role that GZ play in vertical carbon flux in these two regions.  In the Chesapeake Bay, summer populations of the dominant scyphozoan medusae, Chrysaora quinquecirrha, are positively correlated with spring salinity and negatively with dissolved oxygen concentrations.  C. quinquecirrha biovolume has been decreasing from 1985-2011, reducing predation pressure on the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, with cascading effects on copepod abundances.  This top-down control of the food web extends to changes in vertical carbon flux, with the presence of M. leidyi reducing copepod fecal pellet flux by 50%.  In the Sargasso Sea, large salp blooms can completely dominate the zooplankton community, and both cyclonic mesoscale eddies and seasonal changes in primary production can regulate annual salp population dynamics.  Long-term salp population trends are correlated with changes in decadal climate oscillations, and a long-term increase in the most abundant salp species, Thalia democratica, was observed from 1994-2011.  During blooms, salps can graze more than 100% of the primary production, and rapidly export carbon to depth through sinking fecal pellets and carcasses, and through active transport via respiration at depth.  This carbon export to 200 m (average of 2.3 mg C m-2 d-1) is equivalent to 11% of the measured sediment trap flux at the same depth, but salp fecal pellets and carcasses attenuate slowly and can be equivalent to > 100% of measured sediment trap carbon at 3200 m, representing a large export of carbon to the bathypelagic zone during salp blooms.  GZ populations in both the Chesapeake Bay and Sargasso Sea are sensitive to seasonal changes in the environment on annual and interannual time scales.  Long-term changes in GZ abundances could continue into the future, causing corresponding changes in carbon export.

"Zooplankton Community Composition And Grazing In The Amazon River Plume And Western Tropical North Atlantic Ocean"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Conroy_vims_0261D_10007.pdf|"Large river plumes and frontal zones are important physical features influencing plankton distribution in the marine environment. In the western tropical North Atlantic Ocean (WTNA) the Amazon River plume may extend over an area reaching 1.5 x 106 km2. The freshwater plume creates a low-density lens in the surface 25m and supplies silicon and phosphorus to the WTNA. These physical and chemical gradients create an ideal environment for large-scale blooms of diatom diazotroph associations (DDAs), a symbiotic relationship between nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and chain-forming diatoms. While the physical and chemical properties of the plume with regard to influences on phytoplankton have been reported, zooplankton distributions and the fate of enhanced primary production in the plume are largely unknown. I investigated mesozooplankton (>200 μm) composition and grazing in the Amazon River plume-influenced WTNA in spring (May-June 2010) and fall (Sept.-Oct. 2011). Changes in zooplankton distribution and grazing occurred over the sea surface salinity (SSS) gradient from low salinity and mesohaline plume waters to high salinity oceanic waters. Distinct communities were identified in each season along the salinity gradient with several taxa primarily constrained in the surface plume waters (e.g., Lucifer faxoni). The plume appears to function as an “extended estuary”, with a number of taxa (e.g., decapods, euphausiids, and fish larvae) utilizing the plume as a nursery habitat or dispersal mechanism for larval stages. Mesozooplankton grazing was elevated in plume waters compared to oceanic waters and was 2-3 times higher in the fall vs. spring. These patterns suggest a lag in the peak mesozooplankton abundance and grazing in response the observed spring DDA bloom, at least in low salinity plume waters. Comparison of micro- and mesozooplankton grazing along the SSS gradient supported a transition from an “export” food web in waters with SSS < 33 where mesozooplankton grazing dominated and potential for export via fecal pellet production is higher, to a “retention” food web at SSS above 33 where microzooplankton grazing was highest and recycling of nutrients in surface waters is predicted. Using molecular techniques to investigate feeding on DDAs and other N- fixers, I found that copepods consumed DDAs (Hemialus-Richelia and Rhizosolenia- Richelia, diatom-diazotroph respectively) as well as the colonial cyanobacterium Trichodesmium. Investigation of mesozooplankton grazing more broadly on other cyanobacteria with 16S rRNA sequencing revealed consumption of Synechococcus, Prochlorococcus, and the unicellular diazotroph UCYN-A Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa. Together, these results have important implications for our understanding of biogeochemical cycling in the WTNA, and other regions with abundant DDAs (e.g., the Mekong and Congo River plumes).

"Influence Of Perkinsus Marinus Infection And Oyster Health On Levels Of Human-Pathogenic Vibrios In Oysters"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Bienlien_vims_0261P_10001.pdf|"The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is an ecologically and commercially important species whose natural populations have been devastated by overharvesting, habitat destruction, and disease, but the rapid growth of oyster aquaculture has shown potential to restore the economic significance of this species. A key threat to the growth and sustainability of oyster aquaculture is the association of human-pathogenic Vibrio bacteria with product marketed for raw consumption. Two Vibrio species, Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, are the causes of the highest rates of seafood consumption-related mortality and gastrointestinal illness, respectively. Identification of the factors influencing V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus prevalence and intensity in oysters is fundamental to better risk management. Within the oyster, these bacterial species interact with the same tissues as the prevalent oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, yet little is known about the effect of P. marinus infection on bacterial levels. Answering the fundamental question of whether P. marinus correlates with V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus levels in oysters was the focus of this research.  	Oysters were deployed in the York River, Gloucester Point, VA, where both Vibrio species and P. marinus are endemic, and were sampled at five time points when levels of both P. marinus and Vibrio spp. were expected to be high in oysters. Abundance of all three organisms and pathogenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus were determined in individual oysters using molecular methods to investigate potential correlations between parasite and bacterial abundance. Additionally, the levels of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus in relation to histopathology associated with P. marinus infection and other conditions were determined. The following year, manipulation of P. marinus disease progression, which is slowed by lower salinities and favored by higher salinities, was attempted by deploying oysters at two additional sites of different salinities to gain insight into whether the timing of P. marinus infection emergence directly influences Vibrio levels.   	No correlation was observed between total abundance of P. marinus and either V. vulnificus or V. parahaemolyticus. Manipulation of P. marinus disease progression produced no effect on P. marinus emergence, so this yielded no insight into P. marinus-Vibrio interactions. Histopathological analyses did not reveal any correlations between P. marinus ranking, distribution, or associated tissue damage and Vibrio spp. levels. Though few in number, oysters infected by Haplosporidium nelsoni were characterized by higher levels of V. vulnificus, and oysters of peak gametogenic development had significantly higher levels of pathogenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus. The results with regard to H. nelsoni and gametogenic state warrant further study. The primary conclusion of this study is that oyster health has little influence on levels of human-pathogenic Vibrio species in oysters, inter-host variability in Vibrio levels is likely explained by other factors.

"Modulation Of Watershed Nutrient Loads By Tidal Creek Ecosystems On The Virginia Eastern Shore"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Dean_vims_0261P_10008.pdf|"While deeper estuaries typically demonstrate predictable responses to increased nutrient loads, responses in shallow systems are more varied, due in part to the presence of multiple benthic autotrophs. Shallow systems are particularly vulnerable to increases in watershed nutrient loads due to their position at the interface between land and open water. The prevailing conceptual model of eutrophication for shallow systems currently describes a succession in the dominant autotroph from seagrass to macroalgae to phytoplankton, but this model does not include benthic microalgae, which can sequester nutrients in photic systems. The Virginia Eastern Shore is characterized by shallow lagoons connected to upland watersheds through small tidal creeks, where the main source of fresh water and nutrients is groundwater. While some studies have characterized the response of the lagoons to nutrient loads, little is known about the tidal creeks and whether they act as filters, transformers, or conduits for land-based nutrients. We examined the role tidal creeks play in modulating watershed nutrient inputs in the Great Machipongo River (GMR) system, the largest tidal creek complex on the seaside of the Virginia Eastern Shore. We developed a field monitoring program that provided data to calibrate a reduced complexity Estuarine Ecosystem Model (EEM). Production, respiration, and net ecosystem metabolism were quantified, using both the open water and component methods, seasonally at three sites within this system. These rates together with monthly concentrations of standing stock nutrients and water column chlorophyll, monthly DataFlow surveys of physiochemical parameters, seasonally and spatially-intensive benthic chlorophyll surveys, and a bathymetric survey were used to develop and calibrate the EEM. The model was used to assess the degree to which tidal creeks export (via flushing), remove (via denitrification), or transform (via autotrophic uptake) land-based nutrient loads to the adjacent lagoons during baseflow and storm conditions. Component metabolism studies showed the system was overall net autotrophic, with increasing dominance of benthic processes towards the head of the estuary. Open water metabolism studies suggested the system was overall net heterotrophic, but we believe this conclusion is biased by the surrounding marshes and violations of the constant water mass assumption. The creek system exported 61,476 kg N y-1 as phytoplankton biomass, an amount approximately equal to inputs from the watershed and atmosphere, and imported 172,830 kg N y-1 in dissolved inorganic forms for a net import of 111,354 kg N y-1 from Hog Island Bay. Phytoplankton uptake, benthic microalgal uptake, and denitrification accounted for 216%, 343%, and 38% of the annual input of watershed and atmospheric N to the system, indicative of rapid cycling and advection of nutrients from Hog Island Bay. The storm simulation showed that almost all of the additional 28,635 kg N y-1 added from the watershed was flushed to Hog Island Bay and a small portion was denitrified. This study indicates that GMR system function is dominated by benthic processes, and the system acts as a transformer and filter of land-based nutrients during normal conditions and a conduit of nutrients during storm conditions.

"Teachers' Perceptions Of Contextual Influences On Instructional Decision-Making Regarding The Use Of Educational Technology In Secondary Social Studies"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Barger_wmed_0261F_10028.pdf|"This research study was designed to explore the potential connections between teachers’ contexts and their instruction. Specifically, I explored how teachers perceived contextual influences on technology-related instructional decisions in secondary social studies classrooms. I defined teachers’ contexts as comprised of curricular, interpersonal, and organizational or institutional factors existing on three organizational layers, described as macro, meso, and micro. Through a multiple case study design and interpretivist perspective, I studied three cases of individual social studies teachers working in the shared environment of one high school. I viewed the teachers as curricular-instructional gatekeepers (Thornton, 2005) working in a contested classroom space (Craig, 2009). Through this lens, data generation took place at the classroom level and included interviews, observations, and artifact analysis. Data analysis was structured by the Information Ecologies framework (Nardi & O’Day, 1999) to provide a consistent approach for analysis of teachers’ decision-making within and across cases.   Study findings revealed multiple contextual influences that varied in significance across cases depending on the educational orientation of each teacher. Teachers’ contexts and individual educational orientations aligned to varying degrees and resulted in unique curricular-instructional gatekeeping in each case. Accordingly, instructional decision-making regarding the use of educational technology was inconsistent across cases despite the shared environment in which the three teachers worked.

"The Teapots In The Tempest: Ceramics And Military Order At 18Th Century Fort Stanwix"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Scholz_wmgrad_0261N_10002.pdf|"Historically, there has been significant interest in examining pre-contact and historic sites of conflict. Recent studies in historic conflict archaeology have contributed to scholars’ understanding of military sites, specific battles, and sites of sieges and encampments. Archaeological excavations at the 18th century Fort Stanwix in Rome, New York have uncovered a rich assemblage that has facilitated the reconstruction of the fort; however, it is a careful analyses of the artifacts recovered during this process that can help scholars explore life at the fort. Integrating archaeological, historical, and documentary evidence, this paper analyzes the spatial and typological distribution of ceramics at Fort Stanwix. It examines the way the officers and rank-and-file soldiers negotiated power relations as well as the ways that material culture is imbricated in the maintenance of “military order” at this isolated fort. Assuming officers and soldiers maintained strict discipline, scholars may expect to find structures with particular material types and forms of ceramics that signaled status; however, this study confounds the standard assumption. Instead, a careful analysis of the ceramics suggests that even though officers managed to maintain order at Fort Stanwix, the officers and soldiers may have occupied the same structures and did not necessarily rely on ceramics to demarcate status. Ultimately, this study provides a much-needed examination of the ways in which armies maintained discipline in isolated forts and encampments during the 18th century.

"Cameras At Work: African American Studio Photographers And The Business Of Everyday Life, 1900-1970"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Piper_wmgrad_0261E_10022.pdf|"This dissertation examines the professional lives of African American studio photographers, recovering the history of an important industry in African American community life during segregation and the long Civil Rights Movement. It builds on previous scholarship of black photography by analyzing photographers’ business and personal records in concert with their images in order to more critically consider the circumstances under which African Americans produced and consumed photographs every day. During the first half of the twentieth century, urban photography studios constituted essential spaces where African Americans considered ideas of commerce, art, labor, leisure, class, gender, and group identity; “Cameras at Work” situates studio photographers in the history of photography, twentieth-century black cultural politics, and the trajectory of African American business history. The rich records of the Scurlock Studio in Washington, DC center and focus my analysis, which I develop via close comparison of the Scurlocks with a number of other professionals including Morgan and Marvin Smith, Austin Hansen, Louise Martin, and Ernest Withers. These men and women acted locally while empowering African Americans to share their own images nationally, thus contributing to the creation of a wholly American visual culture. Throughout, I treat photographs as objects through which camera operators, consumers, and viewers articulated an understanding of themselves as well as the historical moment in which they negotiated the making of the photograph.

"Putin' On For Da Lou: Hip Hop's Response To Racism In St. Louis"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Harris_wmgrad_0261N_10024.pdf|"The brutal slaying of Michael Brown on August 9, 2014 by Police Officer Darren Wilson is part of an endemic system of institutional racism against Blacks in St. Louis, Missouri. This system takes place in racialized spaces that entail disparate health care, failing schools, commercial redlining, an unjust justice system and several additional oppressive forces. I am seeking to understand the ways in which Hip Hop respond to these systems of oppression. I am interested in Hip Hop’s response because Hip Hoppers are enduring racism. Further, Hip Hop’s representation in popular culture draws attention to misogyny, drugs, violence and the glorification of money. Hip Hop scholars have already provided a significant amount of attention to debunking popular misconceptions and revealing that Hip Hop is so much more. I would like to add to this contribution by focusing on three emcees from St. Louis: Marcus Gray (Flame), Travis Tyler (Thi’sl), and Kareem Jackson (Tef Poe). Their unique background of being from St. Louis, couches them as local experts in which they are able to respond to the killing of Michael Brown, the continued oppressive conditions and localized disenfranchisement. Using a performance studies framework, which involves a focus on embodied behaviors and cultural transmission, this paper analyzes the repertoires of Flame’s, Thi’sl’s and Tef Poe’s performances and activism. I contextualize their responses through a thorough examination of their background and their notions of the evils plaguing Ferguson. I argue that the three models of activism revealed by Flame’s, Thi’sl’s and Tef Poe’s performances in response to the killing of Michael Brown present the ways in which Hip Hop artists respond to the killing of Michael Brown. This paper will explore Hip Hop’s role within the larger Black freedom struggle.

"“Sugary Mixed-Plate”: Landscape Of Power And Separation On 20Th-Century Hawaiian Sugar Plantations"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Gastilo_wmgrad_0261N_10025.pdf|"Archaeology in the Hawaiian Islands predominantly focuses on pre-contact and immediate post-contact contexts, while largely ignoring post-1870 phenomena.   The scarcity of studies examining these settings points out the rich opportunities for investigating dynamics that influenced Hawaiian sugar plantation laborer perceptions of power, authority, and class relations on 20th century Hawaiian plantations.  Part of the Hawaiian sugar planters’ strategy to dominate the political governance of Hawaiʻi and the social dynamics of the plantations was the establishment of racial hierarchies.  Planters reinforced such hierarchies by promoting divisions and segregation and by establishing places of power in the form of managers’ and luna (overseers) residences.  These physical structures served as materializations of planter control reinforcing planter hegemony. This paper analyzes spatial and documentary data from the Pacific Sugar Mill, the Honokaʻa Sugar Company and the Onomea Sugar Company plantations on Hawaiʻi Island using a Marxist lens.  Another theory that is employed to explore how planter hegemony materialized on the sugar plantation landscape of Hawaiʻi is Foucault’s notion of the “panopticon.”  I expected to find structures of power in locations supporting the surveillance of laborer camps.  However, my analysis suggests that Hawaiian sugar management strategies opposed this expectation.  Viewshed analyses indicate that managers and luna had limited surveillance capabilities from their homes, thus contradicting the possibility that an overt direct visual surveillance was an active management strategy.  These findings also suggest that laborer camps located closer to structures associated with plantation management were under more direct surveillance than more isolated camps based on their position within the racial hierarchy.  Additionally, this investigation indicates that the surveilled areas enjoyed more access to facilities located in the core of the plantation such as stores, schools, and hospitals.  Ultimately this analysis of three 20th century sugar plantations in Hawaiʻi highlights the materialization of planter hegemony on the landscape by underscoring the relation between spatial and social distance in the context of racial hierarchies.

Extra-dimensional models of superconductors, motivated by gauge/gravity duality in string theory, have proven remarkably successful in reproducing  qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, aspects of unconventional superconductors. We analyze the universality of some of these  predictions, and discover a universal relation between certain superconducting observables. The second part of this dissertation is about cosmic inflation. The evolution of the universe is sensitive to the fundamental particles and their interactions. We investigate models of cosmic inflation which involve the dynamics of one or more axion fields, and we explain how such models might be related to the flavor structure of the standard model.

"Disorder Effects In Dirac Heterostructures"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/RodriguezVega_wmgrad_0261E_10048.pdf|"In this dissertation, we study theoretically heterostructures based on Dirac mate- rials, i.e. materials, such as graphene in which the electrons behave as massless Dirac fermions at low energies. We first examine how the presence of long-range disorder affects the electronic ground state of a double layer graphene heterostruc- ture formed by two graphene layers separated by a thin dielectric film. We then identify the necessary conditions for the formation of an interlayer exciton conden- sate in such a system. We also comment on the effect of long-range disorder on the broken symmetry ground state induced by electron-electron interactions in bilayer graphene. Then, we study the transport properties of heterostructures obtained by stacking a graphene layer on the surface of a strong three-dimensional topological insulator (TI). In particular, we determine the non-equilibrium current-induced spin density accumulation for these systems using linear response theory and taking into account the effects of long- and short-range disorder both in the limit of strong and weak tunneling between the graphene layer and the TI. Finally, using some of the theoretical approaches developed to characterize the effect of long-range disorder in Dirac materials, we study the effect of long-range inhomogeneities in first-order phase transitions. In particular, we present a theoretical model to describe the ef- fect of inhomogeneities on the relaxation dynamics of vanadium dioxide films after a photo-induced metal-insulator transition.

"Finding Their Place In An American City: Perspectives On African Americans And French Creoles In Antebellum St. Louis"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Roberts_wmgrad_0261N_10050.pdf|"“The Valor and Spirit of Bygone Times”: The Memory of the Battle of St. Louis and the Persistence of St. Louis’s Creole Community, 1820-1847 In the context of the American Revolution, the Battle of St. Louis is a mere footnote, resulting in under 100 casualties. But to the St. Louisans who experienced it – mostly French civilians living in a Spanish territory, many of whom lost loved ones in the battle – it was the defining event of their lifetimes. This paper focuses on two antebellum tellings of the battle story - Thomas Hart Benton's speech in the United States Senate in 1822 and Creole Wilson Promm's speech at St. Louis's anniversary celebration of 1847 - to explore the ways in which Creoles and their allies altered the battle narrative to serve their own cultural or political ends. A close reading of these tales reveals that despite their declining numbers and waning cultural influence, French Creoles remained a distinctive and politically important community in St. Louis throughout the antebellum period. Furthermore, Primm's speech complicates traditional narratives of the nativist moment, showing that some Catholic non-immigrants - such as St. Louis Creoles - risked being targets of nativist prejudice and that they took steps to prevent this, such as invoking the Battle of St. Louis as proof of American bona fides. Crossing Jordan: Black St. Louisans and the Mississippi River, 1815-1860 In the antebellum United States, two rivers – the Ohio and the Mississippi – combined to form a thousand-mile border between slavery and freedom. Yet political boundaries between slavery and freedom do not always map neatly onto cultural or ideological landscapes. A close examination of Mississippi River crossings and trans-Mississippi connections of slaves and free blacks from St. Louis (by far the largest southern city located on the boundary) complicates any simple dichotomy of “Missouri-slave” and “Illinois-free.” In addition to the (hopefully) one-time crossings of blacks fleeing slavery in Missouri, St. Louis free blacks established social networks that extended across the river, and used both temporary and permanent crossings as strategic solutions to problems they faced in St. Louis. At other times, however, they chose to stay in St. Louis, strategic decisions which suggest reveal much about their attitudes toward the river and suggest the limited nature of the freedom available in Illinois. An examination of these crossings reveals the ambiguous and permeable nature of the Mississippi as a boundary between slavery and freedom.

"Managing Micro Vms In Amazon Ec2"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Wen_wmgrad_0261N_10052.pdf|"Micro instances (t1.micro) are the class of Amazon EC2 virtual machines (VMs) offering the lowest operational costs for applications with short bursts in their CPU requirements. As processing proceeds, EC2 throttles CPU capacity of micro instances in a complex, unpredictable, manner. This thesis aims at making micro instances more predictable and efficient to use. First, we present a characterization of EC2 micro instances that evaluates the complex interactions between cost, performance, idleness and CPU throttling. Next, we define adaptive algorithms to manage CPU consumption by learning the workload characteristics at runtime and by injecting idleness to diminish host-level throttling. Experimental results show that a gradient-hill strategy leads to favorable results. For CPU bound workloads, we observe that a significant portion of jobs (up to 65%) can have end-to-end times that are even four times shorter than those of the more expensive m1.small class. Our algorithms drastically reduce the long tails of job execution times on the micro instances, resulting to favorable comparisons against even small instances.

"Turbulent Particle Transport In H-Mode Plasmas On Diii-D"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Wang_wmgrad_0261E_10053.pdf|"Particle transport is an important topic in plasma physics. It determines the density profile of a burning plasma within a tokamak – a magnetic confinement device. Microscopic turbulent particle transport is two orders of magnitude larger than other transport mechanisms for electrons and small ions. In order to confine a plasma in a tokamak with a core density that exceeds the fusion criteria, it is essential to study turbulent particle transport. This thesis investigates how different plasma parameters such as the toroidal rotation and microscopic instabilities affect turbulent particle transport in the DIII-D tokamak. First, we show how toroidal rotation can indirectly affect particle transport, through its contribution to the radial electric field and thus the E ×B shearing rate. The plasma discharge which has best confinement is the one whose E × B shearing rate is larger than or at least similar to the growth rates that drive turbulent transport at the plasma edge. Second, for the first time on DIII-D, we observe a correlation between electron density gradient and instability mode frequency in the plasma core. We find that, when the turbulence is driven by the ion temperature gradient (ITG), the local density gradient increases as the the absolute frequency of the dominant unstable mode decreases. Once the dominant unstable mode switches over to the trapped electron mode (TEM) regime, the local density gradient decreases again. As a result the density gradient reaches a maximum when the mode has zero frequency, which is corresponds to the cross over from ITG to TEM. This correlation opens a new opportunity for future large burning plasma devices such as ITER to increase the core density by controlling the turbulence regime. Finally, we show that, in low density regime, a reduction in core density is observed when electron cyclotron heating (ECH) is applied. This reduction is not the result of a change in turbulence regime nor the result of a change in the density gradient in the core. Through detailed time-dependent experimental analysis, linear gyro-kinetic simulations, and comparison to turbulence measurements we show that this reduction in core density is the result of an increase in turbulence drive at the plasma edge.

"Solving Problems Of The Standard Model Through Scale Invariance, Dark Matter, Inflation And Flavor Symmetry"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Ramos_wmgrad_0261E_10054.pdf|"Through beyond standard model formulations we are able to suggest solutions to some of the current shortcomings of the standard model. In this thesis we focus in particular on inflation, the hierarchy of fermion masses, scale invariant extensions and dark matter candidates. First we present a model of hybrid natural inflation based on the discrete group S_3, the smallest non-Abelian group. The S_3 potential has an accidental symmetry whose breaking results in a pseudo-Goldstone boson with the appropriate potential for a slow-rolling inflaton. The hybrid adjective comes from the fact that inflation is ended by additional scalar fields interacting with the inflaton.  At some point during inflation, this interaction forces the additional scalars to develop vacuum expectation values, then they fall to a global minimum and inflation ends. We continue with another inflation model, in this case involving a two-field potential. This potential comes from the breaking of a flavor symmetry, the one that yields the hierarchy of fermion masses. Depending on the choice of parameters, the path followed by the inflaton may or not reach a point where inflation ends by a hybrid mechanism. For every model presented we study the field content and the parameters to demonstrate that there are solutions that follow the constraints from current experimental observations. Then we move to classically scale invariant extensions of the standard model. We proceed with a model where one-loop corrections break a non-Abelian gauge symmetry in a dark sector. This breaking provides an origin for the electroweak scale and gives mass to the gauge multiplet. For some parameter regions this massive gauge boson is a dark matter candidate. To finish, we also develop a model where we employ strong interactions in the dark sector. The particular dynamics of this model set the electroweak scale and generate a massive pseudo-Goldstone boson appropriate for dark matter.

"Prior Knowledge/esto Perpetua Respublica Americana"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Emanuel_wmgrad_0261N_10055.pdf|"Prior Knowledge: Understanding the world and creating the Treaty of Utrecht through maps and atlases.  Much of the negotiation for what would become the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 actually happened in London in 1711 in the house of Matthew Prior (1664-1721), a poet and diplomat and one of the negotiators. It is possible to reconstruct the information filtering back from across the Atlantic to the actors in this metropolitan space thanks to an inventory of Prior’s property, including his personal library. This was an collection of approximately two thousand books, including maps and atlases, known through an inventory taken at Prior’s death which is now in the British Library. The peace signed at Utrecht secured several British territorial claims in what is now Canada, but left unresolved colonial borders which were to be at issue for many years. It also opened the Pacific to British and French imperial competition. Most importantly, it granted Britain the asiento contract to supply slaves to all of Spain’s American colonies, a contract which would put Britain on track to become the largest slave trading nation of the eighteenth century. An examination of geography books and atlases with information on the Americas and available to one of the principal negotiators helps in understanding the ways in which empire and territorial boundaries were imposed upon the world from an imperial centre and how the lives of millions of people were determined by partially informed agreements made in a house in London. Esto perpetua respublica americana: Use of Fra Paolo Sarpi and of the Venetian example in political discourse by the founders of the American republic.  In 1819, at the height of the Missouri Crisis, John Adams wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson in which he expressed his hope that the young American republic would weather this storm, saying “Esto perpetua.” These were the reputed last words of a Venetian priest who was famed throughout Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for his vigorous defence of the liberty of Venice against the temporal power of the Papacy, Fra Paolo Sarpi (1552-1623). Adams quoted this phrase many times in his correspondence, and he was not alone, the phrase was used throughout the early republican period at times of strain to address concerns over the ability of the republic to endure. Many of the American founders read Sarpi’s works, James Madison even recommending that Congress buy two of them for its own library and suggesting that a third was the best source for discussion of the need to keep churches from becoming powerful in the temporal world by restricting their ability to hold land and incorporate themselves. Although many American thinkers dismissed the Venetian republic as not a useful example of a republic or indeed as not even a republic at all, the idea of Venice as an enduring polity, and the threat to republics which some saw in its fall, was a good reason to look to the Italian city and to Sarpi as sources of inspiration in a young country still struggling with what it meant to be a republic.

By comparing and contrasting Morse’s textbooks with the ages of his intended audiences in mind the paper argues that Morse manipulated his portrayal of geography and citizenship in order to cultivate in his young readers a love for their country. The second paper in this Research Portfolio studies the travel diaries of five teenage girls in the 1920s and 1930s.  By interrogating moments when the girls wrote about alcohol, experimented with their clothing, encountered the opposite sex, and commented on gender norms it becomes clear that while they traveled the girls challenged prevailing white, middle and upper-middle class gender and sexual norms in the United States at this time.  The girls’ attention to sexuality both on their voyages and once in Europe reveals that their understanding of their sexual selves was not solely shaped by what they experienced within the United States but also by what they encountered beyond the country’s borders.

"Dietary Mercury Exposure In Male Zebra Finches Does Not Decrease Their Attractiveness To Females"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Greene_wmgrad_0261N_10057.pdf|"Choosing a high-quality mate contributes strongly to increased reproductive success in birds. Female birds assess quality in males, in part, via condition-dependent signals such as male songs and plumage. The production of attractive signals can be disrupted by environmental stressors, however, including environmental toxins. Mercury, a globally-increasing pollutant, is one such toxin. Mercury exposure has been shown to affect song, plumage, bill color, and mating behaviors in male birds, but the effect of these changes on the outcome of female mate choice is unknown. These effects on condition-dependent signals indicate that mercury could potentially alter males’ attractiveness to females, as females use such traits to assess quality of potential mates. We sought to determine if male attractiveness to females is affected by dietary mercury exposure, using zebra finches as our model system.  Males were either exposed to dietary mercury (1.2 ppm) or unexposed (0.0 ppm), and then assessed by unexposed females in three types of mate preference trials: song-only phonotaxis trials, that observed female preference for mercury-exposed or unexposed songs; two-choice association preference trials, that observed female preference for mercury-exposed or unexposed males in neighboring cages; and aviary pairing trials, in which females were given the opportunity to pair with either a mercury-exposed male or unexposed male. In phonotaxis trials and association trials, females did not spend more time near songs or males of one treatment over the other. In aviary pairing trials, females were equally likely to pair with males of either treatment. While mercury exposure is known to reduce reproductive output in zebra finches and other birds, our results suggest that females are not incorporating mercury-induced variation in male traits into their mate choice decisions. This raises questions about the future evolution of the avian mate choice system in an environment increasingly affected by toxins, as females experience fitness losses as a result of potentially poor mate choice decisions. If this is the case, then females are likely to respond to this sexual selection pressure by including toxin-mediated trait variation in their quality assessment mechanisms.

"Supporting Evolution And Maintenance Of Android Apps"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/LinaresVasquez_wmgrad_0261E_10058.pdf|"Mobile developers and testers face a number of emerging challenges. These include rapid platform evolution and API instability; issues in bug reporting and reproduction involving complex multitouch gestures; platform fragmentation; the impact of reviews and ratings on the success of their apps; management of crowd-sourced requirements; continuous pressure from the market for frequent releases; lack of effective and usable testing tools; and limited computational resources for handheld devices. Traditional and contemporary methods in software evolution and maintenance were not designed for these types of challenges; therefore, a set of studies and a new toolbox of techniques for mobile development are required to analyze current challenges and propose new solutions. This dissertation presents a set of empirical studies, as well as solutions for some of the key challenges when evolving and maintaining Android apps. In particular, we analyzed key challenges experienced by practitioners and open issues in the mobile development community such as (i) Android API instability, (ii) performance optimizations, (iii) automatic GUI testing, and (iv) energy consumption. When carrying out the studies, we relied on qualitative and quantitative analyses to understand the phenomena on a large scale by considering evidence extracted from software repositories and the opinions of open-source mobile developers. From the empirical studies, we identified that dynamic analysis is a relevant method for several evolution and maintenance tasks, in particular, because of the need of practitioners to execute/validate the apps on a diverse set of platforms (i.e., device and OS) and under pressure for continuous delivery. Therefore, we designed and implemented an extensible infrastructure that enables large-scale automatic execution of Android apps to support different evolution and maintenance tasks (e.g., testing and energy optimization). In addition to the infrastructure we present a taxonomy of issues, single solutions to the issues, and guidelines to enable large execution of Android apps. Finally, we devised novel approaches aimed at supporting testing and energy optimization of mobile apps (two key challenges in evolution and maintenance of Android apps). First, we propose a novel hybrid approach for automatic GUI-based testing of apps that is able to generate (un)natural test sequences by mining real applications usages and learning statistical models that represent the GUI interactions. In addition, we propose a multi-objective approach for optimizing the energy consumption of GUIs in Android apps that is able to generate visually appealing color compositions, while reducing the energy consumption and keeping a design concept close to the original.

"Investigating The Relationship Between Event-Related Potentials And Response Kinematics"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Osborne_wmgrad_0261N_10059.pdf|"Movement is one of the most important functions of our nervous system. Recent research has shown that cognitive and perceptual functions ranging from our perception of others’ emotions to the planning of goal-directed behaviors depends critically on brain areas once thought to be primarily motor in nature. Given the important role our motor system plays in understanding and interacting with the world around us, it is surprising that the majority of cognitive neuroscience research using electroencephalogram (EEG) has focused primarily on perception and cognition irrespective of its relationship(s) to the execution of movement. One possible explanation for this is that EEG and event-related potential (ERP) studies typically rely on simplistic motor responses and ERP averaging techniques that do not afford an analysis of these dynamic relationships. Combining a novel method for tracking dynamic cursor movement and single-trial EEG analysis, the current study addressed this limitation in the field via assessment of younger and older adults’ goal-directed movements during a task-set switching procedure. Our results demonstrate that ERPs conventionally interpreted with respect to cognition and perception are in fact related to the kinematics of motor responses.

"Native Americans In The Seventeenth And Eighteenth Centuries"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/McCullough_wmgrad_0261N_10060.pdf|"""Feminized Farmers: Native American Views of English Colonists in the Virginia Chesapeake 1607-1623""      This paper argues that Native Americans in the Chesapeake viewed the English men as feminine because of English male agriculture labor.  The written records of the Jamestown settlers reveal what English colonists thought of the Native Americans.  But the Native Americans left no written record of their views of the English.  This paper seeks to uncover the Native American view the English colonists who established Jamestown from 1607-1623.  By using the English written accounts to track the actions of the English, we can understand what the local Native Americans saw the English doing.  For example, the writings of John Smith or William Strachey reveal not only English opinions, but a record of English actions—actions local Native people observed and used to draw conclusions about their new English neighbors.  Of particular importance was English men’s agricultural labor.  In many Native societies, including those around Jamestown, women performed agriculture labor.  This labor and the food it produced was closely associated with women and femininity.  Similarities in Native and English farming practices allowed Native Americans to draw direct parallels between Native women’s and English men’s labor. By examining how feminized the English colonists appeared and how Native Americans responded to the feminized Englishmen, this paper reveals a Native view of the first permanent English North American colony and its inhabitants.   ““Inconvenienced in the accustomed manner”: Menstruation in the Eighteenth-Century Native Southeast”       The historiography of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, and Creek nations states that during the eighteenth century, Native American women practiced menstrual seclusion. However, women traveled throughout the Southeast, removing themselves from the physical space of the menstrual seclusion house meaning they could not have practiced menstrual seclusion. Tracing these traveling, menstruating women reveals a new view of Southeastern Native American women's menstruation practices. In this paper menstruation is framed as a physical practice dictated by culture. Therefore the fact that not all women practiced menstrual seclusion reveals something about Native culture as well as about the actions of Native women.

"Security And Privacy For Ubiquitous Mobile Devices"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Novak_wmgrad_0261E_10061.pdf|"We live in a world where mobile devices are already ubiquitous.  It is estimated that in the United States approximately two thirds of adults own a  smartphone, and that for many, these devices are their primary method of accessing the Internet.  World wide, it is estimated that in May of 2014 there were 6.9 billion mobile cellular subscriptions, almost as much as the world population.  Of these 6.9 billion, approximately 1 billion are smart devices, which are concentrated in the developed world.  In the developing world, users are moving from feature phones to smart devices as a result of lower prices and marketing efforts.  Because smart mobile devices are ubiquitous, security and privacy are primary concerns.  Threats such as mobile malware are already substantial, with over 2500 different types identified in 2010 alone.  It is likely that, as the smart device market continues to grow, so to will concerns about privacy, security, and malicious software.  This is especially true, because these mobile devices are relatively new.  Our research focuses on increasing the security and privacy of user data on smart mobile devices.  We propose three applications in this domain: (1) a service that provides private, mobile location sharing; (2) a secure, intuitive proximity networking solution; and (3) a potential attack vector in mobile devices, which utilizes novel covert channels.  We also propose a first step defense mechanism against these covert channels. Our first project is the design and implementation of a service, which provides users with private and secure location sharing.  This is useful for a variety of applications such as online dating, taxi cab services, and social networking.  Our service allows users to share their location with one another with trust and location based access controls.  We allow users to identify if they are within a certain distance of one another, without either party revealing their location to one another, or any third party.  We design this service to be practical and efficient, requiring no changes to the cellular infrastructure and no explicit encryption key management for the users. For our second application, we build a modem, which enables users to share relatively small pieces of information with those that are near by, also known as proximity based networking.  Currently there are several mediums which can be used to achieve proximity networking such as NFC, bluetooth, and WiFi direct.  Unfortunately, these currently available schemes suffer from a variety of drawbacks including slow adoption by mobile device hardware manufactures, relatively poor usability, and wide range, omni-directional propagation.  We propose a new scheme, which utilizes ultrasonic (high frequency) audio on typical smart mobile devices, as a method of communication between proximal devices.  Because mobile devices already carry the necessary hardware for ultrasound, adoption is much easier.  Additionally, ultrasound has a limited and highly intuitive propagation pattern because it is highly directional, and can be easily controlled using the volume controls on the devices.  Our ultrasound modem is fast, achieving several thousand bits per second throughput, non-intrusive because it is inaudible, and secure, requiring attackers with normal hardware to be less than or equal to the distance between the sender and receiver (a few centimeters in our tests). Our third work exposes a novel attack vector utilizing physical media covert channels on smart devices, in conjunction with privilege escalation and confused deputy attacks.  This ultimately results in information leakage attacks, which allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information stored on a user's smart mobile device such as their location, passwords, emails, SMS messages and more.  Our attack uses our novel physical media covert channels to launder sensitive information, thereby circumventing state of the art, taint-tracking analysis based defenses and, at the same time, the current, widely deployed permission systems employed by mobile operating systems.  We propose and implement a variety of physical media covert channels, which demonstrate different strengths such as high speed, low error rate, and stealth.  By proposing several different channels, we make defense of such an attack much more difficult.  Despite the challenging situation, in this work we also propose a novel defense technique as a first step towards research on more robust approaches. As a contribution to the field, we present these three systems, which together enrich the smart mobile experience, while providing mobile security and keeping privacy in mind.  Our third approach specifically, presents a unique attack, which has not been seen ""in the wild"", in an effort to keep ahead of malicious efforts.

"The Effect Of Methylmercury On The Auditory Brainstem Response  In Domestic Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia Guttata)"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Wolf_wmgrad_0261N_10064.pdf|"With global urbanization on the rise, human activities continue to threaten the functionality of auditory communication in birds through induced change to vocalizations, the acoustic landscape, and hearing ability. One human-associated pollutant potentially affecting auditory communication is mercury, which is released into the environment through industrial emissions and is correlated with markers of global climate change. Already, mercury has been implicated in mammalian high-frequency hearing impairment; however, the effect of mercury on avian hearing ability is unknown. In this study, we examined whether dietary mercury exposure affected hearing ability in domestic zebra finches using the auditory brainstem response (ABR), which measures the peripheral auditory pathway’s response to sound. Our results revealed that mercury-exposed birds exhibited elevated hearing thresholds, lowered amplitudes, and longer latencies compared to non-exposed birds, all of which argue that methylmercury is degrading hearing ability in domestic zebra finches. When these effects are considered in combination with other anthropogenic stressors that are often correlated with mercury contamination in the field, the hearing impairments we document here could substantially degrade avian auditory communication in nature. This study presents the first evidence of mercury-induced hearing impairment in birds.

"A Precision Measurement Of The Weak Charge Of Proton At Low Q^2: Kinematics And Tracking"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Yang_wmgrad_0261E_10065.pdf|"The Standard Model of particle physics represents our present best understanding of the elementary particles and three of the four fundamental forces. One of the most important and challenging tasks of modern particle physics is to test, and perhaps, to find the evidence for new physics not contained in the Standard Model. One such test, the $Q_{weak}$ experiment, was conducted at JLab in Newport News, VA, from 2010 to 2012. The goal of the experiment is to measure the value of the weak charge of proton, $Q_{weak}$ to a 4\% precision, which, if it confirms the Standard Model prediction, will provide tighter constraints on new physics; or, if it is in disagreement with that prediction, will provide clear evidence for new physics. In this experiment, an 85\% polarized electron beam with 150 $\mu A$ current is used on a 35cm thick hydrogen target to make elastic electron-proton scattering happen at a four-momentum transfer $Q^2=0.03GeV/c^2$. To determine the weak charge, we must also precisely determine the kinematics of the scattering process, namely, the $Q^2$. In order to reach this goal, the hardware, a particle tracking system and special analysis software, the Qweak Tracking Reconstruction software, are both needed. In this dissertation, a full description of the tracking software and the prelimary analysis of the $Q^2$ and the first subset of production data will be given. The proton's weak charge $Q^P_{Weak}$ was measured to be $0.064\pm0.012$, which is consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model.

"Race, Sexuality, And Radicalism In The Piney Woods: The Industrial Workers Of The World And The Brotherhood Of Timber Workers, 1910-1916"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Marquis_wmgrad_0261N_10066.pdf|"Race, Sexuality, and Radicalism in the Piney Woods: The Industrial Workers of the World and The Brotherhood of Timber Workers, 1910-1916. The Brotherhood of Timber Workers (BTW) was an interracial labor organization in the Jim Crow South during the years 1910-1916. The BTW grew out of earlier populist, socialist, and labor organizing in the region and presented a major challenge to the power structure of the area. Southern timber companies banded together to create a virtual military occupation of the area and waged a bitter struggle against the BTW utilizing violence, Jim Crow, and collusion with the state. This struggle was marked by lockouts, a massive espionage apparatus, assassination attempts, and numerous assaults including a shooting incident that left four dead and dozens wounded.   Missing from much of the analysis of the Brotherhood is a discussion of why it affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1912. This article demonstrates that contrary to the historiography of both unions, the BTW should be viewed as an IWW organizing campaign. The Brotherhood was associated with the IWW from its inception and its affiliation represented a legitimate effort on the part of the IWW to confront racial segregation and organize the workers of the Deep South in direct opposition to Jim Crow. Over one hundred years have passed since the BTW was organized in the piney woods of western Louisiana and eastern Texas, and the racial politics of the union are still poorly understood. This article calls into question whether segregation was uniformly employed by the union and its locals before affiliating with IWW in 1912 and demonstrates that the BTW’s racial policies and actions changed over time to become more inclusive, although they were still flawed. Furthermore, this work will show that gender and sexuality were components of the same hierarchical power structure that drove the engine of Jim Crow. The racial components of this campaign cannot be comprehended outside of an understanding of how gender and sexual relations of power or hierarchies operated in the subjugation of the workforce.  In addition to secondary analyses, this essay utilizes primary documents from multiple archives, newspapers, and court records.

"Impacts Of Invasive Phragmites Australis On Diamondback Terrapin Nesting"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Cook_wmgrad_0261N_10067.pdf|"The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) is a species of turtle found exclusively in brackish water habitats. Terrapins are currently facing population threats including by-catch mortality in crab pots, predation, and habitat loss. The expansion of the exotic, invasive reed Phragmites australis is causing widespread structural and functional changes to coastal ecosystems throughout North America, which could negatively impact the nesting success of female terrapins by invading preferred nesting habitats. I examined the extent to which Phragmites affects nesting of a breeding population of diamondback terrapins at Fisherman Island National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Virginia, where Phragmites has recently expanded into known areas of terrapin nesting. With data collected from the 2015 nesting season I quantified the impacts of this expansion on terrapin nesting by: determining the extent to which nest incubation temperature is impacted by Phragmites shading, determining how Phragmites density impacts the risk of rhizome invasion into nests, and determining how the presence of Phragmites impacts predation of terrapin nests. I also examined landscape features to determine which factors may be associated with diamondback terrapin nest site use. I found that Phragmites cover greater than 50% would decrease incubation temperatures of terrapin nests sufficiently to produce predominantly male hatchlings. There was no effect of Phragmites cover on root growth into simulated nests, but cover by other dune plant species explained observed trends in root growth. I did not find a significant effect of Phragmites on nest predator activity, but did find that Phragmites had an impact on terrapin nest site use on Fisherman Island. Distance from nest to nearest marsh and tidal creek also influenced terrapin nest site use. With crab pots and roadways contributing to high adult mortality every year, high nesting success will be highly important to maintaining and propagating this charismatic species.

"The Impact Of Surface Normals On Appearance"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Moore_wmgrad_0261E_10068.pdf|"The appearance of an object is the result of complex light interaction with the object. Beyond the basic interplay between incident light and the object's material, a multitude of physical events occur between this illumination and the microgeometry at the point of incidence, and also beneath the surface. A given object, made as smooth and opaque as possible, will have a completely different appearance if either one of these attributes - amount of surface mesostructure (small-scale surface orientation) or translucency - is altered. Indeed, while they are not always readily perceptible, the small-scale features of an object are as important to its appearance as its material properties. Moreover, surface mesostructure and translucency are inextricably linked in an overall effect on appearance. In this dissertation, we present several studies examining the importance of surface mesostructure (small-scale surface orientation) and translucency on an object's appearance. First, we present an empirical study that establishes how poorly a mesostructure estimation technique can perform when translucent objects are used as input. We investigate the two major factors in determining an object's translucency: mean free path and scattering albedo. We exhaustively vary the settings of these parameters within realistic bounds, examining the subsequent blurring effect on the output of a common shape estimation technique, photometric stereo. Based on our findings, we identify a dramatic effect that the input of a translucent material has on the quality of the resultant estimated mesostructure. In the next project, we discuss an optimization technique for both refining estimated surface orientation of translucent objects and determining the reflectance characteristics of the underlying material. For a globally planar object, we use simulation and real measurements to show that the blurring effect on normals that was observed in the previous study can be recovered. The key to this is the observation that the normalization factor for recovered normals is proportional to the error on the accuracy of the blur kernel created from estimated translucency parameters.  Finally, we frame the study of the impact of surface normals in a practical, image-based context. We discuss our low-overhead, editing tool for natural images that enables the user to edit surface mesostructure while the system automatically updates the appearance in the natural image. Because a single photograph captures an instant of the incredibly complex interaction of light and an object, there is a wealth of information to extract from a photograph. Given a photograph of an object in natural lighting, we allow mesostructure edits and infer any missing reflectance information in a realistically plausible way.

"Living In The Past: Community And Change In Historical Commemorations At Plymouth, Williamsburg, And Salem"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Simpson_wmgrad_0261E_10070.pdf|"Where we live, how long we’ve lived there, and what events we associate with that location all help us define ourselves.  Having a hometown celebrated for a particular historical narrative can bring a lot of benefits – an economic boost, national attention, fame, and even fortune.  But it also poses problems when national attention and local interests come in conflict.  In this dissertation, I explore the ways in which local historical commemorations were shaped by – and came to shape – the towns in which they developed.  This has much to tell us about how the historical tourism industry can affect a local community, and also how our understanding of the past is shaped by who gets to tell the stories. In the quest to understand the interaction between communities and commemorations, I look at a series of case studies: Plymouth, MA; Williamsburg, VA; and Salem, MA.  I chose these locations because of an important factor they share: all are towns in which a local story (dating broadly to the colonial era) has long held a place in the American imagination.  Plymouth is famous for the landing of the Pilgrims in 1620.  Williamsburg is noted as one of the birthplaces of the American Revolution.  Salem is notorious for the witch trials that rocked the community in 1692-1693.  All three sites also share a long history of historical commemoration, and their historical tourism has come to define them. In Chapter 1, Plymouth exemplifies a place with a long tradition of locally-led historical commemoration.  This provided a framework for the tercentennial celebrations held there in the 1920s and for the institution of Plimoth Plantation after World War II.  The strong local hold on their own story helped townspeople dictate the terms in which Pilgrim history was told.  In Chapter 2, I examine a city with a less organized tradition of local commemoration: Williamsburg.  While local history was treasured and celebrated, there was not an established framework of commemoration.  This made it easier for “outsiders” and professional historians to take control of the narrative.  In Chapter 3, Salem serves as a counter-narrative: a place with a notorious and widely-known history, but one which locals generally preferred not to celebrate or commemorate.  I show how the community’s treatment of witch trial history affected the development of institutions commemorating the town’s past.  My study is further complicated by Chapter 4, in which I consider the treatment of Native American history at these sites.  After considering the negotiation between local voices and professional historians at Plymouth, Williamsburg, and Salem, I explore how this minority has struggled to have their own story told.    Together, my case studies reveal that the development of living history was not inevitable.  Many factors, including local attitudes and traditions, economics and demographics, trends in the historical profession, and even social movements, all played a part.  As these commemorations evolve and institutionalize, they have consequences for the communities in which they exist and for the stories we tell ourselves about the past.

"Molecular And Performance Properties Of Poly(Amides & Imides) And The Use Of Graphene Oxide Nano-Particles For Improvement"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Hocker_wmgrad_0261E_10071.pdf|"Macroscopic properties of polymers, and in general all types of materials, are innately related to their molecular structure and intermolecular properties. This dissertation offers insight into how the molecular structure, chain properties, and inter-molecular chain interactions within PA11 can be used to explain and predict improved macro level performance properties; and how the addition of graphene oxide nanosheets enhances the performance properties of PA11 and polyimide(ODA-BTDA) through those same intermolecular interactions. Chapter 3 describes the unexpected result that weak small organic acids at low concentrations hydrolyze a polyamide at rates approximately twice that of a water HCl solution of the same pH at 100 ˚C and 120 ˚C under anaerobic conditions. Chapter 4 discusses how by varying the rate of Mm degradation with small organic acids the correlated effects of Mm and crystallinity upon the ultimate strain of PA11 were decoupled. The result demonstrates the need for both crystallinity and molecular weight knowledge to monitor and predict the ductile to brittle transition and when embrittlement occurs. Chapter 5 explores the elevated resistance to hydrolytic degradation and molecular properties that a graphene oxide (GO) loaded PA11 has compared with neat PA11 at 100 and 120 ˚C. The decreased rate of degradation and resulting 50 % increased equilibrium molecular weight of PA11 was attributed to the highly asymmetric planar GO nano-sheets that inhibited the molecular mobility of water and the polymer chain. The crystallinity of the polymer matrix was similarly affected by a reduction in chain mobility during annealing due to the GO nanoparticles’ chemistry and highly asymmetric nano-planar sheet structure. Chapter 6 extends the experimental work to effects on polyimides. GO and GO functionalized with 4-4’ oxydianiline (ODAGO) are incorporated at 0.01 to 0.10 wt% into a polyimide (PI) made from 3,3’-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) and 4-4’ oxydianiline (ODA). The performance properties of these two systems GOPI and ODAGO-PI at extremely low GO concentrations of 1 part per 10,000 are comparable to previous results citing concentrations 10 times higher and displayed significantly greater improvement than unfunctionalized GOPI films. The results suggest that the improved barrier properties are due a toruosity effect of the GO sheets and to a stabilizing effect of the flakes on the polymer matrix, where reduced mobility of the PI chain reduces diffusion through the polymer matrix. ATR-FTIR, WAXS, Raman and Tg results support this view.

"Radiant Exposure: The Art And Spectacle Of The X-Rayed Body In American Visual Culture"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Tirak_wmgrad_0261E_10072.pdf|"Radiant Exposure analyzes how American painting, photography, cinema, and graphic design creatively visualized X-rays to represent the body under forms of invasive scrutiny. I will historicize a variety of works produced between 1895 and the present, which consist of actual X-ray photographs and artistic simulations of their visual effects. Visual culture scholars and art historians have identified the X-ray as an important development in modern experience, perception, and the visual arts, but they have situated the X-ray's aesthetic bearing in the first thirty years after Wilhelm Röntgen’s discovery of the X-ray. I argue that since their invention, X-rays have persisted in the realm of the corporeal spectacle, as a source of aesthetic captivation and a method of social control.  My goals are to generate a new language for articulating the rich significance and specific influence of X-rays in American consciousness, through formal and historical analyses of visual culture that draw from X-rays' technological effects or appropriate them in different ways. More broadly, this project reveals how the subjectivity of American identity has projected onto the anonymous irradiated body in the visual arts, whether idealized or pathologized, made culturally visible or cloaked in invisibility. As Americans have become more transparent under modern surveillance, the X-rayed body in art and visual culture has become entangled with ideas about identity and power.

"Resolution Limits Of Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry With Pulsed Source"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Qu_wmgrad_0261E_10073.pdf|"Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) is a time-of-flight mass spectrometry commonly used to detect a wide mass range of biomarkers. However, MALDI requires a high laser pulse energy to create ions with a mass higher than 50,000 Daltons. That high laser energy increases the net ion production but it also degrades the instrument's mass resolution. This project uses a Room Temperature Ionization Liquid (RTIL) as a liquid matrix with a self healing surface instead of a standard crystal matrix to increase shot to shot reproducibility, enabling a systematic study of the origin of the resolution degradation. This study shows that the main source of the resolution degradation is the ionic space charge which delays the ejection of ions into the acceleration region, essentially increasing the ionization pulse time to be as long as hundreds of nanoseconds. This study includes simulation and experimental results to document this effect.

"Contact And Explicit And Implicit Bias Towards Latinos/as"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Koech_wmgrad_0261N_10074.pdf|"The positive effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction have been well established, with prior research demonstrating that real or imagined contact with outgroup members can reduce implicit and explicit racial bias (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Turner, Crisp, & Lambert, 2007). The current research assessed non-Latinos’ to more closely examine the relationship between contact and explicit bias (Study 1) and implicit bias (Study 2) towards Latinos. Additionally, this work examined if imagining a contact scenario with a Latino stranger was sufficient in reducing bias compared to those imagining contact with a stranger of unspecified race/ethnicity and if this effect could be mediated by alleviation of each integrated threat theory classifications (realistic threat, symbolic threat, intergroup anxiety, and negative stereotypes; Stephan & Stephan, 1996). Study 1 results indicated that the individuals with more close, current contact with Latinos exhibited lower explicit bias towards this racial/ethnic group. Study 2 replicated Study 1’s finding that current, close contact predicted explicit bias to an extent, although Study 2 provided little evidence to support that current, close contact is a predictor of implicit bias (i.e., stereotypic associations, attention allocation, and affect) towards Latinos. Study 3’s manipulation of imagined contact did not yield differences in biases (neither implicit nor explicit) between the two groups. However, there were significant relationships between implicit associations, explicit biases, and each of the four threat classifications. This research has broad implications for the contact hypothesis literature and for non-Latino/Latino interactions in everyday life. Future research should continue examining non-Latino and Latino intergroup interactions to help determine mechanisms to reduce bias.

Specifically, I argue that officials in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama began the twenty-first century by implementing an imperial grand strategy to keep the international system organized around a dominant center and a subordinate periphery in a global structure of imperialism. By showing that officials in both the Bush and Obama administrations kept each region of the world integrated into a global structure of imperialism, my dissertation intervenes in one of the key debates in diplomatic history to define how the United States functioned as an empire.

"Differences In Sockeye Salmon Antibody Composition: Testing The Immunological Imprinting Hypothesis"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Chappell_wmgrad_0261N_10077.pdf|"Anadromous fish such as sockeye salmon return to their natal streams to spawn, during which they undergo significant physiological changes including the release of cortisol, a known immunosuppressive hormone. Our lab has proposed the Immunological Imprinting Hypothesis, which suggests that juvenile anadromous fish respond to pathogens specific to their natal site by producing protective long lived plasma cells (LLPCs) that constitutively produce antibodies against those pathogens. These LLPCs are believed to be highly cortisol resistant. Thus, fish returning to their natal streams have immunological protection from pathogens found at that specific location.  I investigated the Immunological Imprinting Hypothesis through analysis of antibody composition and usage. Since 2009 samples of Sockeye Salmon spleen and anterior kidney have been harvested from two separate salmon runs in Alaska. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) I examined the relative usage levels of specific VH gene families between fish at different locations. To further investigate the “pathogen fingerprint” of given spawning sites, I also performed qPCR analysis in order to compare the pathogen loads of multiple pathogens from different sites, including Bacterial Kidney Disease (Renibacterium salmoninarum), Bacterial Coldwater Disease (Flavobacterium psychrophilum), and Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHNV). Analysis of VH family usage suggests that differences exist between certain spawning locations not only for selected individual VH families, but also for multiple VH families analyzed simultaneously. Likewise, pathogen loads and infection rates are found to differ frequently between many spawning sites, while probability of infection is shown to be dependent on location for each pathogen analyzed. Analysis of VH usage and pathogen loads suggests several correlations that exist between specific usage patterns and lower pathogenic loads. Greater understanding of spawning fish immune functioning can potentially suggest a method of natural immunization against common fish pathogens and thus protect both farmed and wild populations. These differences in VH usage patterns and pathogen infection rates between spawning sites provide strong evidence in support of the Immunological Imprinting Hypothesis.

"Algorithms For Large Scale Problems In Eigenvalue And Svd Computations And In Big Data Applications"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Wu_wmgrad_0261E_10079.pdf|"As ”big data” has increasing influence on our daily life and research activities, it poses significant challenges on various research areas. Some applications often demand a fast solution of large, sparse eigenvalue and singular value problems; In other applications, extracting knowledge from large-scale data requires many techniques such as statistical calculations, data mining, and high performance computing. In this dissertation, we develop efficient and robust iterative methods and software for the computation of eigenvalue and singular values. We also develop practical numerical and data mining techniques to estimate the trace of a function of a large, sparse matrix and to detect in real-time blob-filaments in fusion plasma on extremely large parallel computers. In the first work, we propose a hybrid two stage SVD method for efficiently and accurately computing a few extreme singular triplets, especially the ones corresponding to the smallest singular values. The first stage achieves fast convergence while the second achieves the final accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a high-performance preconditioned SVD software based on the proposed method on top of the state-of-the-art eigensolver PRIMME. The method can be used with or without preconditioning, on parallel computers, and is superior to other state-of-the-art SVD methods in both efficiency and robustness. In the second study, we provide insights and develop practical algorithms to accomplish efficient and accurate computation of interior eigenpairs using refined projection techniques in non-Krylov iterative methods. By analyzing different implementations of the refined projection, we propose a new hybrid method to efficiently find interior eigenpairs without compromising accuracy. Our numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. In the third work, we present a novel method to estimate the trace of matrix inverse that exploits the pattern correlation between the diagonal of the inverse of the matrix and that of some approximate inverse. We leverage various sampling and fitting techniques to fit the diagonal of the approximation to that of the inverse. Our method may serve as a standalone kernel for providing a fast trace estimate or as a variance reduction method for Monte Carlo in some cases. An extensive set of experiments demonstrate the potential of our method. In the fourth study, we provide first results on applying outlier detection techniques to effectively tackle the fusion blob detection problem on extremely large parallel machines. We present a real-time region outlier detection algorithm to efficiently find and track blobs in fusion experiments and simulations. Our experiments demonstrated we can achieve linear time speedup up to 1024 MPI processes and complete blob detection in two or three milliseconds.

"Bayesian Mind: Making Sense Of Probability-Based Decision Making Strategies"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Byun_wmgrad_0261N_10081.pdf|"Bayesian probability problems are notoriously difficult for people to solve accurately. Base rate neglect refers to the hypothesis that people ignore base rate information in preference for individuating information when making these probability judgments (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973). Correct answers to base rate neglect problems often require complex Bayesian calculations involving probability information embedded within realistic event descriptions. The past research emphasis on base rate neglect responses for such problems has overlooked the fact that responses can actually vary widely across participants and within participants from one problem to the next. The verbal protocol analyses of participants’ decision making processes found in the current study revealed that participants use a variety of cognitive strategies to solve such problems. The between-participant and within-participant variability can result from simple miscalculations to difficulties with translating probability statements into numerical calculations. This translation process can be further complicated by idiosyncratic subjective interpretations of the event descriptions and a basic misunderstanding of objective probability information. The results of the current study highlight that improving an individual’s Bayesian reasoning requires the instructional procedure to be tailored to their sources of difficulties, and that individual protocol analyses could help define these instructional procedures.

"Individual Differences In Social Cognitive Processes Between Neurotypical College Students High And Low In Autistic Traits"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Mitchell_wmgrad_0261N_10082.pdf|"The autism spectrum may extend into the general population, as previous work has suggested that there is a normal distribution of subclinical autistic traits among neurotypical individuals. Individuals with high levels of autistic traits display interpersonal challenges that are qualitatively similar to those exhibited by individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In ASD, social challenges may be mediated by differences in social cognition. The current study investigated to what extent social cognitive differences exist between individuals with high and low levels of subclinical autistic traits. Participants were 171 undergraduate students who scored high or low on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Differences were found between High AQ and Low AQ participants along several social cognitive and behavioral dimensions. High AQ participants reported higher levels of social anxiety and fewer daily conversations than Low AQ participants. Accuracy on a Theory of Mind task was lower in High AQ than Low AQ participants, but only when stimulus eye gaze was averted. Patterns of preferential attention to faces also varied between High AQ and Low AQ participants, contingent on configural and temporal factors. Low AQ participants exhibited a stronger attentional preference for upright faces versus cars and inverted faces at 100ms. When a competing car stimulus was presented, High AQ participants preferentially attended to faces more strongly than did Low AQ participants at 200ms and 500ms. Inverted face distractor stimuli elicited a stronger attention bias to upright faces by Low AQ than High AQ participants at 500ms. Emotion complexity did not differentially affect preferential attention to faces between the two groups. These results build on previous literature by characterizing specific patterns of social cognitive processing differences associated with subclinical autistic traits.

"Private Schools For Blacks In Early Twentieth Century Richmond, Virginia"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Smith_wmgrad_0261N_10083.pdf|"ABSTRACT The Virginia State Constitution of 1869 mandated that public school education be open to both black and white students on a segregated basis.  In the city of Richmond, Virginia the public school system indeed offered separate school houses for blacks and whites, but public schools for blacks were conducted in small, overcrowded, poorly equipped and unclean facilities.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, public schools for black students in the city of Richmond did not change and would not for many decades.  Before 1918, there was no public high school for black students to attend.  Whites made it clear in their words and in their actions that they felt that blacks were inferior to whites and that money should not be wasted on the education of black children.  Annual reports from the Superintendent of Public Schools for the city of Richmond, Virginia and newspaper articles from both black and whites press evidence that whites were strongly opposed to providing an education to black students that was equal to that of whites.  As early as 1866, private schools for blacks became a part of Richmond’s educational landscape to provide primary and secondary education to blacks who were denied quality education by the public school system.  This thesis concludes that if private schools for blacks were not an option in the city of Richmond in the first half of the twentieth century, some black students would have not received an education beyond the primary level.

"Expanding The Scope Of Terminal Alkynes In Chemical Biology"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Maza_wmgrad_0261N_10086.pdf|"The terminal alkyne is one of the most widely used chemical moieties in chemical biology. Thanks to the relative absence of this functional group in biology, it has become a widespread functional handle for a plethora of biorthogonal chemistries. Our group has extended the scope of this functionality by developing a biological variant of the Glaser-Hay coupling, which brings together two terminal alkynes to form a diyne linkage. However, our initial findings revealed that the chemistry is plagued by protein degradation due to a deleterious copper(II) hydroxyl intermediate. Herein we extend the scope of the terimanl alkyne be developing a biological variant of the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, which brings together a bromoalkyne and a terminal alkyne to form a diyne linkage. Unlike the Glaser-Hay, the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz is thought to be net redox neutral. We found that this chemistry is biologically compatible and does indeed reduce copper(II)-mediated cytotoxicity while increasing rates of diyne formation. Finally, we extend our findings on diyne-forming chemistries by applying this conjugation to a variety of projects, ranging from undergraduate teaching labs, bioconjugate preparation, and protein function, thereby expanding the scope of this conjugation strategy.

"Study Of Variations Of The Dynamics Of The Metal-Insulator Transition Of Thin Films Of Vanadium Dioxide With An Ultra-Fast Laser"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Radue_wmgrad_0261E_10087.pdf|"Vanadium dioxide is an intensely studied material, since it goes through an insulator-metal transition at a critical temperature just above room temperature at 340~K. The dramatic change in conductivity and the easily accessible transition temperature makes it an attractive material for novel technologies. Thin films of VO2 have a reversible transition without any significant degradation in contrast, and depending on the microstructure of the films, the properties of the transition are tunable. In this work, I study the dynamics of the insulator-transition in thin films grown on different substrates using a pump-probe configuration. The energy needed to trigger the transition, as well as the time constants of the change in reflectivity are affected by the strain in the VO2 films. I also characterized the samples using Raman spectroscopy and XRD measurements in order to identify what underlies the differences in behavior. Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Yamaguchi's group at RPI, I show that it is possible to trigger the transition using a THz pulse that directly pumps energy into the lattice, and at lower energies than needed to pump films by photoinducing the electrons across the band gap.

"Thyroid Hormone Receptor Nucleocytoplasmic Transport"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Jibo_wmgrad_0261N_10089.pdf|"The thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) and the thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1) are transcription factors that modulate the expression of target genes that are important in metabolism and development in response to thyroid hormone. Although primarily localized to the nucleus, prior studies have shown that TRα1 and TRβ1 shuttle rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and that nuclear import of TRα1 is directed by two nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs: NLS-1 in the hinge domain, and NLS-2 in the N-terminal A/B domain. In contrast, TRβ1 lacks NLS-2. Previous studies also characterized two nuclear export signal (NES) motifs, NES-H3/H6 and NES-H12, that reside in the ligand-binding domain and mediate TR nuclear export. Here, we investigated which importins mediate nuclear import of TRa1 using a combined approach of shRNA-mediated knockdown and coimmunoprecipitation assays in HeLa (human) cells. Among all the importins we tested in transient transfection assays (importins 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, importin β1, and adaptor importin α variants), only importin 7, importin β1, and adaptor importin α1 knockdown experiments resulted in a significant localization pattern change from primarily nuclear to a more cytosolic distribution of TRα1. To demonstrate direct interaction between TRα1 or TRβ1 and these importins, “GFP-trap” co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. Importin 7, importin β1, and adaptor importin α1 were shown to interact with TRα1, while importin 4 as a negative control, did not. Our data show that nuclear entry of TRα1 in HeLa cells is facilitated by both importin 7, likely through interactions with NLS-2, and importin β1 and the adapter importin α1 interacting with NLS-1 and NLS-2. In contrast, TRα1 nuclear import is facilitated only by importin α1/β1 interacting with NLS-1. Prior results from knockdown and overexpression studies provided evidence that multiple exportins influence TR localization. Here, we investigated which exportins serve as a direct carrier for each of the multiple NES motifs in TRα1, using “GFP-trap” coimmunoprecipitation assays. The information would be provided in Chapter 5. Consistent with our prior studies, results show protein-protein interactions between TRα1 and XPO4, XPO5, and XPO7, but not with XPO6. Taken together, our findings highlight a fine balance of nuclear import, retention, and export that modulates TR function.

"Uncanny Objects: The Art Of Moving And Looking Human"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Vo_wmgrad_0261N_10091.pdf|"Automata (""self-moving"" machines) and reborn dolls (hyperrealistic baby dolls) individually conjure up questions of dynamic and aesthetic realism--external components of the human form as realistically represented or reproduced.  As simulacra of humans in movement and appearance, they serve as sites of the uncanny exemplifying the idea in which as varying forms of the cyborg imbue them with troubling yet fantastical qualities that raises questions about our own humanness.   My first essay, “Automaton: Movement and Artificial/Mechanical Life” directly addresses the characteristics that define humanness, principally the Rene Descartes mind-body dichotomy, by tracing the evolution of mechanical life, predicated as much on movement as consciousness, via the construction of automata.  “Dis/Playing with Dolls: Stigmatization and the Performance of Reborn Dolls” takes the discussion a step further and examines people’s reactions when objects that look human are treated like human.  I compare observable behaviors of dolls owners via social mediums like videos posted on YouTube, message boards, blogs, and news sources with responses by observers of this type of doll play, and superimposing a theory of play over this interaction.  Whether or not automata and reborn dolls are socially accepted as signifiers of humanness, they already exist within our social space and reality.  It is the recognition and acknowledgement of their presences in our everyday life and their agency that puts them squarely in the discourse of life.

"Longitudinal Links Among Adolescent Friend Emotion Socialization, Emotion Regulation, And Internalizing Symptoms: The Role Of Gender"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Braunstein_wmgrad_0261N_10092.pdf|"Emotion socialization is the process through which individuals learn acceptable forms of emotional expression within their particular social contexts. Although it is widely recognized that peers are a critical influence on adolescent development, most research on emotion socialization has examined parental influences on their children’s emotions (Zeman et al., 2013) with little attention paid to how friends socialize each other’s emotions.  One form of emotion socialization occurs in the responses to emotional disclosures. Initial evidence indicates that specific friend emotion socialization responses to negative emotions are related to adolescents' own psychological functioning, concurrently and longitudinally (Klimes-Dougan et al., 2014). However, research has not explored possible mechanisms that might explain this link. The current study examines the longitudinal relation between friend socialization responses to negative emotions and adolescents' internalizing symptoms (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) through the mediator, emotion regulation, and how this relation differs between girls and boys. Data were collected at two time points (M = 23 months apart) from 139 youth (T1, Mage = 12.66 years; T2, Mage = 14.50 years, 54.5% female, 77.0% White). Youth responded to questions about the socialization responses they typically receive from a close friend, anxiety and depressive symptoms, emotion regulation abilities, and friendship quality. Moderated mediational analyses were conducted using the Process macro for SPSS (Hayes, 2013). Results indicated that specific types of supportive, but not unsupportive, emotion socialization responses were prospectively related to anxiety symptoms and emotion regulation, and these relations differed between girls and boys. For boys, greater expectations of receiving supportive Reward and Override responses were related to stronger emotion regulation, and greater expectations of receiving supportive Magnify responses were related to increased anxiety symptoms. However, unsupportive socialization strategies did not predict anxiety symptoms, and no emotion socialization responses predicted depressive symptoms. Lastly, stronger emotion regulation was associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms in all models even after controlling for T1 anxiety, depression, and friendship quality. These findings provide further evidence that friend emotion socialization responses are related to adolescents' functioning over time and these relations differ between girls and boys.

"The Constitution Of Disability In The Early United States"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Daen_wmgrad_0261E_10094.pdf|"“The Constitution of Disability” examines the creation and implementation of bureaucratic, legal, institutional, and cultural categories of disability in the Early American Republic. Scholarship in early American studies, disability studies, and the history of medicine has been slow to account for disability—and its status as a political, legal, and administrative classification in particular—during the period. This dissertation shows how disability became a meaningful designation in diverse venues, from the provision of federal and state pensions to wounded veterans and deaf and blind students to the restrictions imposed on those deemed to be cognitively disabled by state and federal courts.  A wide range of sources underpin the study. Governmental and legal records demonstrate the role of political officials and judges in formulating and refining disability categories as well as how these constructs were negotiated by those who both claimed and rejected the designation. Institutional accounts, newspaper advertisements, patent documents, visual art, and material objects reveal how Americans developed and contested disability classifications in various sectors of the market economy. Writings by physicians expose the increasing medicalization of the category of disability. In addition, genealogical materials, such as census records and family histories, facilitate the recovery of the lives and experiences of many impaired and disabled people.  Ultimately, the dissertation argues that Americans—bureaucrats, judges, institutional administrators, artists, inventors, producers, and consumers—struggled to determine what disability meant and therefore who should be entitled to the benefits and strictures associated with the classification. As a result, many turned to physicians to preside over the designation of disability. These emerging professionals used the specialized and seemingly impartial language of medicine to lend the category of disability greater shape, weight, and authority. They also used their newfound positions as adjudicators of disability to assert and claim professional status.  By the mid-nineteenth century, disability was a more standardized, medicalized, and significant administrative, institutional, and cultural categorization and physicians were viewed as experts on disability policy and disabled people.

"Cabinet Of Monkies: Dancing Politics In Anglo Culture, From Jacobite To Jacobin And Royalist To Republican"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Stallings_wmgrad_0261E_10095.pdf|"Dance has long been known to play a significant role in the social lives of men and women in colonial British America. What historians have largely failed to note is the integral nature of dance, in particular the longways English country form, to the realm of politics and the formation of national identity. From the earliest days of its dissemination in print, English country dance served a political purpose. In 1651, under Oliver Cromwell’s dour Protectorate government, Royalists like publisher John Playford used dance as a subtle form of resistance. Urging the public to remember the monarchy fondly and to join together in a quintessentially English pastime, Playford’s English Dancing Master created an imagined community of political dissenters. The Playford manuals set the standard for the politicization of dance in Anglo culture, both in the politically-charged dance titles they contained and in the intended function of dance performance itself. This awareness of dance’s potential and the tendency to employ it for political ends were carried across the Atlantic to England’s North American colonies. In the years preceding the American Revolution, as well as during the war itself, the ballroom became a political space to a heightened degree. While minuets established a clear social hierarchy, country dances broke it down into more democratic forms. Codes of conduct at assemblies allowed attendees (especially women) to publicize their political allegiances through their dress, behavior, and dance selection. Both the British and the Americans, up and down the eastern seaboard, sought to turn the politicization of the ballroom to their advantage; spectacular fetes such as Howe's Mischianza won local populations to the British cause, while the Philadelphia Assembly prohibited Loyalists from subscribing to its events. Partially in response to British extravagance, the Continental Army characterized its festivities as orderly, economical, and virtuous. In the Federal era, political rivals again used dance as a form of propaganda, warring over the legacy of independence. International tensions ran high as France found itself embroiled in a bloody revolution that sent a new wave of emigres fleeing abroad. Many settled in the United States and often made a living teaching dance. Pro- and anti-French feeling spilled over into the ballroom. As the rise of the middle class rendered dance an understandable language across a wide swath of the voting population, two major themes arose:  that of dance as a wholesome rustic activity in keeping with lauded classical virtues, and that of the social-leveling, chaotic frolic, imbibed with vice and dangerous Jacobin principles.  An analysis of dance metaphors reveals growing discomfort with race relations and with the political aspirations of the lower classes, suggesting the gradual closure of the window of opportunity that independence had proffered. English country dance persisted into Jacksonian America, despite the rise of French cotillions and quadrilles. Though it was a tool of reconciliation after the War of 1812, the longways set’s association with egalitarianism made it a target for anti-Jackson feeling by the 1820s. Changing styles in dance and politics also undercut the role of the ballroom. Women assumed a more public role in rallies and social movements, and small-set and partner dances allowed dancers to self-segregate, hindering large-scale communication on the dance floor.

"Methodism, Slavery, And Freedom In The Revolutionary Atlantic, 1770-1820"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Jones_wmgrad_0261E_10098.pdf|"From its quit arrival in the British colonies of North America in the 1760s, Methodism unexpectedly grew to become America's largest Protestant denomination by the early nineteenth century. But its rapid growth was not limited to the early United States. Methodist missionaries attracted large numbers of converts in Britain's remaining North American and Caribbean colonies. This dissertation analyzes the connections that linked and ultimately divided Methodists across political, social, and racial lines throughout the Atlantic world, arguing that the movement’s rapid expansion amidst revolutionary change led to the fracturing of the transatlantic ties that united its adherents.  This project thus expands the geographical borders of early American Methodism to include regions beyond the United States, including Britain’s Maritime, Canadian, and Caribbean colonies, and even venturing across the Atlantic Ocean to the West African community of Sierra Leone, where a large number of former slaves from the American South resettled following the American Revolution. Methodists spoke of themselves as a connection, a term that signified both their adherence to the teachings and theology of John Wesley and their attachment to other Wesleyan Methodists across the globe. The events of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, including political revolutions in North America and the Caribbean, slave rebellions, and growth of the abolitionist movement exposed strains within the Methodist connection, as adherents divided over national allegiance and race. “Methodism, Slavery, and Freedom” is organized into six broadly thematic chapters covering the period from 1770-1820. The first chapter sets the stage for those that follow, tracing the migrations of several groups of Methodists in the wake of the American Revolution. Methodists found themselves on all sides of the conflict, and participated in both the Loyalist diaspora and the republican march westward. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 propose a reexamination of Methodist attitudes toward slavery and antislavery, examining the impact of Methodist connections between the United States and the Caribbean on institutional policies and individual activities. Chapter 5 shifts attention the impact of revolutionary events and racial tensions on the ecclesiastical politics of Methodism, comparing and contrasting the first independent black Methodist churches in the United States and West Africa. The sixth and final chapter returns to some of the themes explored in chapter 1, analyzing the experience of Methodists in the United States-Canadian borderlands from the American Revolution through the War of 1812.

"Compton Scattering Polarimetry For The Determination Of The Proton’S Weak Charge Through Measurements Of The Parity-Violating Asymmetry Of 1H(E,e')P"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Cornejo_wmgrad_0261E_10100.pdf|"The Standard Model has been a theory with the greatest success in describing the fundamental interactions of particles. As of the writing of this dissertation, the Standard Model has not been shown to make a false prediction. However, the limitations of the Standard Model have long been suspected by its lack of a description of gravity, nor dark matter. Its largest challenge to date, has been the observation of neutrino oscillations, and the implication that they may not be massless, as required by the Standard Model. The growing consensus is that the Standard Model is simply a lower energy effective field theory, and that new physics lies at much higher energies. The Qweak Experiment is testing the Electroweak theory of the Standard Model by making a precise determination of the weak charge of the proton (Qpw). Any signs of “new physics” will appear as a deviation to the Standard Model prediction. The weak charge is determined via a precise measurement of the parity-violating asymmetry of the electron-proton interaction via elastic scattering of a longitudinally polarized electron beam of an un-polarized proton target. The experiment required that the electron beam polarization be measured to an absolute uncertainty of 1 %. At this level the electron beam polarization was projected to contribute the single largest experimental uncertainty to the parity-violating asymmetry measurement. This dissertation will detail the use of Compton scattering to determine the electron beam polarization via the detection of the scattered photon. I will conclude the remainder of the dissertation with an independent analysis of the blinded Qweak .

"""turkey Is The Key"": Studies On America's Relationship With The Ottoman Empire, The Turkish Republic, And Islam In The Near And Middle East"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Fischer_wmgrad_0261N_10102.pdf|"ABSTRACT Mission Accomplished: Manifest Destiny and American Foreign Missions to the Ottoman Empire in the 1830s William Goodell’s memoir, Forty Years in the Turkish Empire, was a compilation of some of his journals, letters, and other writings during his tenure as a missionary living in Constantinople. This paper analyzes Goodell’s motivations, activities, and reflections during the 1830s in order to discuss Goodell’s role as an agent of Manifest Destiny. Though the United States did not have the desire or ability to conquer the Ottoman Empire by the sword, some Americans asserted their power through the spread of religion, and many of these Americans supported the efforts of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). William Goodell provides a view into the Protestant missionaries from the United States to the Ottoman Empire and the world at large who, in the 1830s, were intrinsic component of the burgeoning Manifest Destiny mentality and reflected physical American expansion westward in the form of Christian American expansion eastward. These evangelical missionaries were also a force of expansion, and a strand of manifest destiny expressed in the form of ideological imperialism. “A Colorful and Turbulent Career”: Depictions of Turkey in American Tourist Guidebooks, 1920-1935 Americans who wanted to visit Turkey around its establishment as a nation could consult a variety of sources which help to demonstrate the American perceptions of the Turkish Republic and its leaders during the 1920s and 1930s. The ultimate marker of these American guidebooks is the time they devoted to Robert College in Constantinople. These authors’ depiction of Robert College as an American stronghold in the Oriental East represents the type of Western gaze that acted as a penetrating force and constituted a mental and physical imposition on Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s, a process which continued as travelers used the guidebooks for their various needs. This paper discusses the differences in wants and needs between the Turkish government and Western travelers, reconciled effectively through the reality of İstanbul as the destination of choice for Westerners who wanted a taste of the Orient that was still comfortably “Western.” "|Maureen|Julia|Julia|Fischer||mjfischer@email.wm.edu|"College of William and Mary - Arts & Sciences"|"Paul  Mapp"|"Hiroshi  Kitamura"|"Guillaume  Aubert"|"Leisa  Meyer"||History|"Master of Arts (MA)"|History|http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/|thesis||"2018-09-27 00:00:00"|English||2016-07-01|Fall|None|1477068545

"Does Sound Help Prevent Birds From Flying Into Objects?"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Ingrassia_wmgrad_0261N_10105.pdf|"Bird strike is the often fatal collision between a bird and a surface, such as a window or tower.  Collisions kill millions of birds each year in the US alone, and cost industries millions of dollars per year.  As more buildings, wind turbines, communication towers and other structures are built, bird strikes and its associated costs are predicted to increase.  Researchers have explored mitigative measures to alleviate bird strikes but to date none have solved this growing problem.  Recent research suggests that current technologies fail because their design does not take into account birds' sensory ecology, including habituation to loud sounds and some species may lack the ability to effectively see visual deterrents while flying.  In this study we explored an acoustic mitigative measure against bird strike.  Our goal was to use directional sound as an instrument to warn flying birds of an upcoming visible barrier in their flight path.  We hypothesized that when birds experienced a strong sound field (80 dB SPL) in the presence of a visible mist net, they would increase their body and tail angles of attack, enabling them to slow down.  Our results show that when flying zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) encountered a loud sound field in front of a visible barrier, they slowed their flight (relative to a control flight) by approximately 25% and simultaneously increased their body and tail angles of attack by 25° and 50°, respectively.  This alteration of velocity and flight posture will likely increase birds’ capacity to maneuver, due to increased tail drag and improved tail lift, and potentially afford individuals more time to initiate avoidance maneuvers.  Collectively, our results support the conclusion that a conspicuous sound can decrease birds’ risk of striking a static surface or object.  Our study suggests that emitting sound in front of windows, wind turbines, power lines, as well as cell, radio and communication towers could decrease bird strikes and associated damage and costs.

"The Mind Of The State And Thinking About Sex"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Munda_wmgrad_0261N_10106.pdf|"The Mind of the State Throughout the War of the Spanish Succession, European powers vied for supremacy, both on the Continent and across the Atlantic.  This paper examines the English intelligence apparatus during this conflict.  In so doing, it shows the extent to which intelligence shaped state functions during the conflict, and how understandings of intelligence and information in general influenced state understandings of the international stage and their approaches to conflict. Thinking About Sex In the early 1720s, the British state launched a series of raids against molly houses – social spaces patronized by homosexual men – across the country.  This paper explores discursive developments from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries in an attempt to understand what allowed the British state to understand homosexual individuals and from what avenues they derived their authority.  Ultimately, drawing upon Foucauldian analysis, the paper considers developments in intelligence as critical to state understandings of sex and sexuality during the period.

"Apocalypse Now: War And Religion In Late Colonial And Early Republic America"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Penn_wmgrad_0261N_10107.pdf|"ABSTRACT French “Idolators,” British “Heretics,” Native “Heathens”: The Seven Years’ War in North America as a Religious Conflict  With France and Great Britain as its primary belligerents, the Seven Years' War was an international conflict with a decidedly religious dimension, one based on the longstanding rivalry between Catholicism and Protestantism. In North America, the conflict galvanized clergymen in both the British and French colonies to frame the war as a religious struggle with potentially apocalyptic consequences. This discourse remains understudied by historians, and efforts to address religion's role in America during the Seven Years' War is usually one-sided, focusing either on the French or British experience. This paper aims to fill this historiographic gap by analyzing both sermons produced by Protestant ministers from across the American colonies and pastoral letters issued by the Catholic Bishop of Quebec between 1755 and 1763. Moreover, this paper argues that both French and British religious leaders viewed the Seven Years' War as an extension of the Catholic-Protestant European religious wars of the previous century, and believed that the conflict's outcome would determine the survival of their respective religions in North America. This paper also describes how Native Americans figured in this discourse, employing a combination of captivity narratives written by Protestant ministers and the reports of Jesuit missionaries to further illustrate the war's perceived apocalyptic significance. ABSTRACT “The English Establishment Is, Itself, Of a Beastly Nature”: Catholicizing Great Britain in Pro-War American Discourse During the War of 1812 In order to catalyze support for their cause against the British during the War of 1812, pro-war writers in the United States revived a rhetorical device that had once served their Revolutionary predecessors: the casting of Great Britain as an anti-Protestant and practically Catholic agent. Specifically, these writers were reacting to claims made by certain New England religious and political authorities shortly after the war’s inception that Great Britain was Protestantism’s “bulwark,” and as a result should be viewed as an American ally rather than as an enemy. An examination of pro-war newspaper articles and published sermons ranging in origin from Vermont to Maryland demonstrates how pro-war writers deconstructed Great Britain’s historically accepted role as Protestantism’s defender. It also reveals how this rhetorical strategy intensified in comparison to its brief employment during the Revolutionary period, thanks to the manner in which Napoleonic France was perceived as an effective check against the Papacy. Finally, these sources demonstrate the extent to which pro-war writers employed apocalyptic imagery from the biblical Book of Revelation to bolster their denunciation of Great Britain, which they argued stood alongside the Catholic Church as one of the beasts of the Apocalypse.

"“The Improvements Made By America On The Ancient Mode”: Classicism And Nationalism In The Early American Republic, 1780-1850"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Strickland_wmgrad_0261N_10108.pdf|"Classicism, an interest in the history, society, and arts of the ancient world, became a staple of American culture with the first permanent European settlements, and reached its zenith in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The extant scholarship on early American classicism offers a wealth of information about how citizens of the nascent United States read and interpreted the sources of the ancient world. However, it has done little to address the political utility of that classicism. The first of the two studies presented here attempts to locate one possible utility of American classicism in the Federalist Papers. An examination of allusions to the ancient world in those texts and the educational background of its authors and audience provides evidence that a shared American classicism was a constituent part of the cultural unity necessary to justify a strong central government. The second study reexamines this culture of classicism in the first half of the nineteenth century, with a focus on the classicism of nonelite demographic units without access to conventional higher education. While nonelite subjects have been analyzed by many other historians of American classicism, they have largely been examined discretely. This study establishes the prevalence of classical culture in the early nineteenth century United States by examining the public writings and speeches of elite white men. A subsequent analysis of nonelites contextualizes their classicism in the larger American classical culture in an attempt to demonstrate the broad unity of American classicism.

"Subjects Or Rebels: The Dominion Of New England And The Roots Of Anglo-American Conflict / The Right To Fortifications: American Communities And The Politics Of Harbor Defense: 1794-1812"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Slattery_wmgrad_0261N_10109.pdf|"ABSTRACT Subjects or Rebels: The Dominion of New England and the Roots of Anglo-American Conflict This paper argues that the process by which the English Crown’s initially modest attempts to tweak New England colonial governance dovetailed into a reactionary denial of all colonial liberties. The imposition of autocratic imperial rule and armed occupation of New England reflects the fundamental bankruptcy of the “imperial constitution,” namely, the incompatibility of the right of colonists to representative assemblies and the imperial authority of the English state. Because on a constitutional level the two were incompatible, a protracted conflict between colonists and metropolitans had a strong likelihood of ending in logical extremes neither party expected or wanted: the abolition of colonial self- government by the English state and a revolutionary attack on the authority of the English state by colonists. As long as colonists and metropolitans failed to reconcile colonial rights with metropolitan sovereignty, they papered over a zero sum game. This paper is preliminary and based upon an initial reading of sources; additional research of contemporary scholarship in particular would improve it. ABSTRACT The Right to Fortifications: American Communities and the Politics of Harbor Defense: 1794-1812 This paper argues that American seaport towns played an outsized and determinative role in the fortification of their harbors in the immediate post- revolutionary period. While historians have examined the individual and collective efforts of military engineers during this period, they have neglected the importance of the labor, financial and political resources of cities in realizing seacoast defense. I found strong connections between urban politics and urban seacoast fortifications at every level from grassroots community organizations to the halls of Congress. To complete this project and properly qualify its conclusions, however, a comprehensive analysis of legislative dynamics and seaport populations would be necessary. This paper might serve as the nucleus of future research on the relationship between American communities and fortifications.

"Morbid Love: American Decadence In The 1890S"|http://doiassist.endofinternet.org:8000/etds/Gable_wmgrad_0261E_10111.pdf|"This dissertation engages with a neglected group of writers, artists, and intellectuals in the United States who identified with Decadence, a European literary and artistic movement. Decadence was a label, embraced by some, that refers to a state of art and literature that suggests the end of an Empire: luxurious, imitative, corrupt, sensuous, and ultimately worthless.  Self-professed Decadents elevated artificiality, morbidity, sensuality, and pessimism.  They also lived lives, both imaginary and real, of separation from the world, attempting to fully embody otherness as they watched the world change around them and anticipated the fall of civilization.  I question how these supposedly foreign ideas worked in America, in a transatlantic conversation that reveals yet another aspect of the transition to modernity in America. I suggest “morbid love” as key to understanding the cultural work of Decadence, using it to mean both a love of illness and disease that the Decadents evidenced, as well as a love that in itself was doomed to death. In this dissertation I argue the following. First, I build on work establishing the existence of American Decadence by emphasizing the cultural engagement of Decadence despite its self-professed insularity and rarity. Second, I argue that Decadence in America exemplifies a particular moment in the intellectual histories of degeneration theory and sexuality that has been largely ignored. While most studies of degeneration theory emphasize the power of the theorists and the low social status of theorized, Decadents brought degeneration to the upper classes, the learned, those with cultural capital. They acted as both theorists and theorized. In terms of sexuality, Decadence created a space that fit into neither the standard acts paradigm, nor the following identity paradigm, suggesting that sexuality was a matter of artistic and aesthetic choice and taste. Third, I argue that these deviations from standard narratives show that American Decadents performed a political queerness that functioned as a cultural critique and created a space that complicates our understanding of the period. Each chapter of this dissertation explores an aspect of the Decadent cultural criticism, emphasizing the deliberate queerness, or morbidity as they would phrase it, of their stance. It is now standard in studies of structures to examine the construction of the “normative” condition (whiteness, heterosexuality, masculinity, etc.) rather than the deviant. I argue, however, that this approach automatically associates those with power as normative and those without as deviant. I hope in this work to complicate that narrative.
